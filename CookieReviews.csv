"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I think these were formulated using the ""and-then-the-flood"" school of culinary thought. Chocolate cookies with chocolate chips and white chips and chewy texture AND fudge in the center.My main complaint was that they were too small. I'm pretty sure that cookies like original Chips ! are smaller than when I was a kid (and it ain't because my hands are bigger) and that's OK. Nothing is like it was when we were kids (said the old poop). However, these seem smaller even than ""regular"" cookies...and you must consider the source here, I'm not a regular cookie eater. I would rather spend my calories on a hand full of chips than dessert usually.There IS a dessert eater in my house...and he approved of these, but they were not his favorite. So we give this 2 and a half (translated in Amazonian to 3) stars. Good for something different, but not likely to displace your favorite cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are really gooey and chocolaty, more scrumptious than any human being can withstand! They taste like super rich brownies with the extra quality of being gooey. At 150 calories per cookie, this bag contains enough food energy to blow most bank vault doors off their hinges, so be forewarned! Nabisco has gotten the ingredients right with this one also. As you may know from my other reviews, I am very hard on manufacturers who do not use acceptable ingredients. This has my seal of approval. So, if you are not concerned about counting calories, or if you are one of those rare individuals who actually CAN eat just one, then see if you can withstand the rapture of eating these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Let's see, a fudge cookie with milk chocolate and white chocolate chips that is also filled with gooey fudge, what's not to love?  I honestly only ever need one to appease my sweet tooth and satisfy my chocolate cravings.  At 75 calories for one cookie it is certainly a splurge, but they can certainly be enjoyed in moderation.Serving size - 2 cookies. 150 calories, 7g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 110mg sodium, 80mg potassium, 21g carbohydrate (13 g sugar, less than 1g fiber), 1g protein.Contains: wheat, milk, soy."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge lived up to  a one of their claims: they were are chewy cookie- and very sweet. The fudge part was the most disappointing. You couldn't even taste it. Honestly, I didn't care for the flavors. The chocolate didn't taste like the real stuff and it was too sicky sweet to finish."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"For every two small cookies that you eat, you are ingesting 150 calories.  That seems WAY higher than it should be for the flavor that you get.  (I would much rather eat one and a half 100 calorie packs of randomn cookies for the cost of those calories...)Additionally, although not GROSS, I just don't think that they taste nearly as good as other more normal chocolate chip cookies.  (It really must be the gooey center, which, though very sweet, doesn't really add much oomph, and, in my opinion, wasn't very tasty).I was disappointed by these and would never purchase them.  Not recommended for Chips  Lovers.* One bright side, however, the packaging is pretty good.  The top has an innovative cover which peels open to reveal the cookies, but allows itself to be resealed (with the sides sticking back to the top again, creating an airtight seal)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Even the worst cookie is still good right?My first impression after biting into this cookie that is claiming to be chewy and gooey: ""Wow! Why does this taste powdery?"" Second bite: the same. The weird chalky fabricated taste stayed from start to finish. In addition to this strangeness was the the eerie feeling that these cookies weren't even baked. It seemed more like they were pressed out of a mold.This all being said, I did eventually eat the whole bag but I would never buy them again.I would most certainly never recommend these to anyone."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The Megafudge (unlike some of the flavors) is a good-tasting cookie; however, it is not so incredible that it makes up for the fact that 150 calories are found in two fairly small (about the size of a half dollar coin) cookies.  The cookies are soft and have a fudge center that's quite yummy."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"We tend to be homemade cookie fans around our house. But, for those times when we do pick up a package of store bought, Chips 's regular chewy chocolate chip cookies are usually among the top choices. So I thought these would be worth a try. They are good - nothing phenomenal or fantastically exciting, though. I will say that I don't think Chips  did as well with the chocolate cookie as they do with regular chewy chocolate chip cookies.What I expected: A moist, chewy cookie with a slightly runny, ""gooey"" center. Essentially, I expected something like the picture on the package.What I found: A slightly less moist than expected cookie with a center that was more like fudge - not hard, but also not gooey.Bottom line: The kids definitely thought they were good, even my spoiled ""homemade cookie only"" son. Because they were not gooey, they also weren't very messy. That makes serving one to busy kids does not result in chocolate everywhere! I did like that. I doubt these will make it to the ""top choices"" category, but we enjoyed the package we tried."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I shared these with people in the office. Below is what they said. I myself liked them a lot. I found it hard to stop eating them. I could easily down the entire package at once which would not be good! I really like the soft center.Comments:- Smells like home and almost tastes like it too!!- OK.  They seemed kind of moist to me.  2 were stuck together.  I didn't like that. (Editors note: Moist is good!)- Awesome.  I like the fudgy center and the crunchy white chocolate chips.  I bet if you heated them in the microwave, it might be like they just came out of the oven.- Very soft and fluffy with an even softer, gooey center. It's small and light which makes the addition of chocolate chips a bit too much. Would have been much better if it were a plain chocolate cookie with a fudge filling."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"When it comes to cookies, especially the soft cookies, I'm usually the first in line.  So I was excited to see the new Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  Unfortunately, the megafudge description never made it into my package.  It turned out to be a major letdown.Now, these cookies seemed to have plenty of chocolate, but you never could taste it.  In fact, they were bland.  The cookies were a bit on the dry side with moments of gooey morsels that did little to introduce flavor of their own.  It's hard to downplay a cookie described as megafudge as not having much taste, but it's true.  Hopefully the other varities are more appealing."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm a chocolate lover and when I need a real sit down munch out choco fest these are right up there on my list.  What could be better than choco cookie with choco chips and a fudgy center that will make you lick you lips with pleasure.  YUMMY!Can you imagine these mixed in some ice cream, crumbled up and layered in a torte or even better crumbled up and put in a peanut butter sandwich.  Yup I'm talking serious stuff with these guys.  I do like the fudgy ones better as they have a regular soft choco chip cookie but hey when it calls for heavy artillary they will fit the bill.Oh just have a great idea.  How about these as smores.  Just put the hot dripping marshmallow in the middle of two cookies and ohhhhhhh the taste.  Just so you know these are a, ""You can't eat just one cookie"".  :)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I requested two types of Chips !'s newest cookies.  These were tasty, and the others were not.  So don't interpret this review as relevant to similar cookies... just these alone.The cookies tasty chocolatey and don't have an overpowering processed aftertaste one finds with many foods of this type.  They are very sweet, but you can tell you're eating a chocolate cookie.  In moderation (I had two at most at a time) it's decent and easy snack.  They are very chewy, almost a dough consistency, but the cookie doesn't fall apart easily. I think the frosting center helps the cookie's structure.Very good with a cup of black coffee."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Ok, maybe it's just getting older, but this is overkill. I can eat a handful of chocolate chips but 2 of these cookies make that handful seem like being on a low-cal diet. If you are a kid or a real chocolate addict, you'll like them, but for the rest of us, it's just too much of a chemical buzz"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I received a package of both these and the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge... so I will compare both of them.  These are excellent cookies for a store bought cookie. They are soft and have a great flavor.  I am a big brownie person and so I totally gobbled up this variety and LOVED them. My husband, on the other hand, is an avid chocolate chip lover and greatly preferred the Chocofudge version.  Lots of chocolate inside makes it an awesome cookie... no more plain cookie if you happen to be low on chips in each bite. EACH bit is guaranteed chocolate since it has a nice chocolate center, and the cookie itself is like a mild brownie/cookie cross, so it's REALLY great for a chocoholic! But it's not overbearing at all, it's really done quite nicely.  My only complaint is really towards store cookies in general: they all have a tendency to have that store bought chemical taste (I think it's the preservatives). Nothing quite like homemade in that regard!  So I took off a star for that. SOME expensive brands somehow mange this by having quick expiration dates, and if you want to spend the money on those it's worth it!  I didn't have any crumbly issues... my package arrived safe and intact!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I think it is not a great sign when a package of cookies in a house with 5 people ends up being tossed before being finished.THey were not horrible but I would not want to spend money on these or reccomend them.First off they are fairly small and thin, not that smaller protions sizes for desserts are bad, it is just not condusive to the idea of GOOEY.I found these to be way more ""dry"" and couldn;t really see what was supposed to be ""gooey"""
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The description sounded great but the cookies didn't really live up to the promise.  It is not that the cookies were terrible, they weren't - but they weren't particularly good either - just 'mmehh'.  The chocolate had a funny 'off' sort of taste.  The texture was rather dry and crumbly.  There are lots of cookies I like better, including just regular Chips s. If I am going to indulge in this much fat and calories I want something that tastes a whole lot better than these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Chips ! is a mass-production outfit, so there's always going to be something a bit industrial about the cookies they turn out. These are definitely very edible and, if not exactly addictive, I could (and did) find myself putting away more of them than I should at one sitting. These all-chocolate ones (""Megafudge"") are better than the traditional version, but still, the quality of the chocolate was, again, industrial at best. My wife, who knows her chocolate, said it tasted like they were trying to craft something darker than milk chocolate without the characteristic bitterness of true dark chocolate. She didn't think they succeeded. But if you're not looking for a connoisseur cookie experience and just need something for the snackin', these might not be bad to keep in the cabinet. If they make it there before you eat them all."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I mostly make my cookies from scratch, but it's nice to have an emergency treat on hand. These cookies are soft (for those that fall into the ""I love soft, not crunchy"" cookie camp).They have a cocoa taste and a bit of creamy fudge in the center. This improves when you stick it in the microwave for a few seconds.The only thing I think is a negative, is the package is bulky for how many cookies you end up getting. I wish they gave us more for our money.Having said that, they are tasty in a store-bought way."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Marginally better than the regular Gooey Chips , but it still didn't leave a great impression.Personally, I didn't care for the taste that was full of preservatives and was the furthest thing to the standard home or stored baked cookies. It's interesting that they were able to keep the chocolate soft inside the cookie, but it didn't add any value to the cookie. The cookie was indeed soft, crumbly, w/ lots of chocolate inside but the overall taste was just too unnatural to enjoy.It's not something I'd recommend."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I was not all that impressed with the Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  These are probably not a product I would buy in large quantities for my family,I liked that this is a soft cookie and there is a center full of chocolate.I did not like that the chocolate seemed to have a funny artificial aftertaste and that the cookies fell apart easily.  There are lots of cookie crumbs left in the package and I resorted to having people eat them outside because they fall apart and make such a mess."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I thought this cookie was decent tasting for a store-bought cookie, thus the 4-star rating (it would only be 3-star if including homemade).  The texture was a bit too soft, with the cookie having a tendency to crumble.  I tried this cookie at room temperature, cold, and heated in the microwave, and it remained good for store-bought but there are others I like better.  My favorite thing about this cookie really was probably the easily resealed package...."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are okay for grocery store cookies made with preservatives.  They aren't as good as Nestle Tollhouse or Mrs. Fields but they're better than the unrecognizable brands one might buy at a gas station.  The ""gooey"" filling is surrounded by a chocolate ""shell"" within the cookie and makes for contrasting textures - soft cookie, chocolate shell and gooey center.  While these are in the Chips  line, they are quite different from the original.  Not better or worse.  Just different.I prefer the ""Megafudge"" Chips  over the ""Chocofudge""."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I'm a ""soft cookie"" fan, and these cookies fit the bill. They're nice and chewy. Best of all, they're super chocolately! They're not very big, but that's okay because the flavor is so rich. I couldn't eat a lot at a time, but for a decadent snack, these are perfect. My kids loved them, too. If you like soft, chewy cookies and chocolate, you won't be disappointed in the Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"You must love chocolate to enjoy these, they are very good cookies.Pros:- Soft.- Chocolatey goodness- Some brownie like tasteNeutral:- The chocolate inside is not melted like in the pictures, (unless you microwave them for a few seconds) but this was to be expectedCons- Fat- Saturate fat- Servings size: 2 small cookies.If you can eat just 2 of these and be happy, I salute you. They are addictive, but also have like 50% of the saturated fat for your whole day.Eat with care"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Maybe it's me, but I was deeply disappointed in Chips 's Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies. First, they're the size of a half-dollar and crumbled when I picked them up, so that makes them a little dry. Not mega; not chewy gooey. They were packed with white chocolate chips (although, I wished they were macadamia nuts). They had a slight chocolate flavor but not fudgy that's for sure.There are about 15 cookies to the package, but for some reason my package must have shifted in shipping and many of my cookies were in pieces. Needless, to say I wasn't happy with this cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I am the world's greatest fan of the original Chip's s.  Have loved 'em for decades and they are my ""go to"" cookie.  But --- these Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge are just not my cup of tea (sorry for that metaphor).I like chewy fresh baked cookies.  And I like the rather crispy original Chips s!.  But these things are neither.  To my tastes, they are just a somewhat soggy, crumbly, ultra-megadose of chocolate.I love to give glowing reviews when I can, especially for my favorite brand names -- but I'll leave my share of these cookies to rabidly addicted over the top chocolate fudge addicts.  These are just not for me."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I am reviewing these cookies from the sample that I received via the Vine program.  Admittedly, I did not get to try them at their best.The package arrived broken to smithereens, and in 100+ degree weather (Florida summer) that had fused the leaking fudge and crumbs into a unpalatable mess (see photo uploaded).  Getting over the look, I tried a clump, but I did not like the taste or the now ""gritty"" texture.  I honestly can't say if this was because they had been smashed and ""re-baked,"" or if this was the original taste and texture, but I expect the former.  They seem more brownie-like than cookie, but again, that could be because of the way I received them.Once again, I am reviewing the sample that I received, hence I am giving a mediocre three-star review: not bad, but not good either.  The best I can suggest is that you buy these from your local grocery store.  Shipping fudge cookies in the heat of summer is definitely not the way to go!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The first thing I noticed about these cookies was the package. Even the most careless kid or husband (or maybe wife, to be fair about it!) is going to find it easy to close this package and keep the cookies fresh....That is, if you care that they are fresh. After I opened the package I found the cookies were all stuck together (Witness my spouse's comment, ""Hey, those are BIG cookies!"" To which I replied, ""No, that is three cookies stuck together. "").After separating the cookies, I broke one in half and found that the result was a crumbled exterior and an interior that resembled partially cooked cookie dough more than a ""gooey"" filling.  It was not at all what I expected from the description or the picture on the bag.The taste was not too bad, but it was a bit salty-tasting, as others have noted.To be fair, this cookie would probably appeal to kids, but I would make them eat it outside or at the table; else there will surely be a lot of crumbs. Adults who just want some chocolate to go with a cup of coffee might find it satisfactory also. But for both there are probably better choices."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"There's not much I can think of to say for this product other than the kiddos and I joyously devoured these yummy, chocolatey, chewy cookies.  We experimented with a few to heat them slightly in the microwave and some we tried to make ice cream sandwiches, that was slightly messy...but it was all good.  Heck, my niece willing, yet slightly grudgingly, ate a serving of cooked spinach just so she could eat more of them. If that's not a positive endorsement, I don't know what is."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The calories in these are unbelievable for the tiny size (only a little bigger than Girl Scout Thin Mints).  They're also incredibly addictive, even though they're really a bit overly sweet to my taste.  They have that kind of artificial softness and bright, sharp taste a lot of the more artificial cookies have also.On the other hand, I can't say I didn't enjoy them and feel like I ate way too many.  I do recommend microwaving.Here is the link to the nutrition info:[...]Each cookie weighs about 15 grams and manages to be 75 calories!I will say they're easy to eat and appealing in some ""can't stop"" way but...I'd kind of be happy to not have them in my apartment again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I was a little disappointed by the Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge.First, the good news.  I liked the density of white chocolate chips, as well as the chocolate flavor of the cookies.  Both excellent.  However, I didn't like the consistency of the cookie, the cloyingly sweetness, and not much of a fan of the gooey interior.  As others suggested, I heated the cookie for 20-30 seconds in the microwave prior to eating.  The cookie was far too crumbly, and broke apart in my hands.  The interior, while gooey as promised, did not contrast sufficiently in texture with the exterior cookie shell; the whole cookie felt soft, crumbly, and gooey.  I would've appreciated some differentiation.Kids seem to love 'em, but adults, not so much."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies are a definite improvement over regular Chips , but I didn't experience the amount of fudge center I thought I would, based on the advertisements.  In fact, it was difficult to discern any difference between the middle of this cookie and a regular chewy cookie.However, just going by taste, these were a winner.  Just don't expect an oozing fudgy center."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Wow- I never thought I would say this, but these have too much chocolate. If you want a bit of extra fudge, go for the regular fudge filled cookies... these ones that also have chocolate cookie are just too much. Two cookies in and I had heart burn from the amount of sugar and chocolate in this cookie. If you are a super chocoholic then these might be right up your alley... but they were just too much chocolate for me."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"How does one go about reviewing a cookie?These arrived, and my kids were thrilled.  We each had a couple of cookies, then saved enough for everyone to have one when we were all home.  The responses were all enthusiastic.One child really loved the combination of white and semisweet chocolate chips.  Another commented that it was like eating a little brownie cookie.  I loved the texture.Everyone agreed that these cookies were really delicious and tasted more like something from the bakery than something from a package.  I think it was the gooey fudge filling part -- which was just enough to make the cookie really soft, and not enough to make it a real mess (which I was afraid of).This is something we will buy again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I thought these were a little better than the Chips  gooey cookies, but still not worth a second try to me. At least they didn't have the strange aftertaste of the other cookies. They were ""fine,"" but just not feeling tons of love for them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Nabisco's new Chips ! Chewy, Gooey, MegaFudge cookies are incredibly rich.  With a soft cookie that tastes more like a brownie, chocolate and white chocolate chips on the outside, and a soft and creamy chocolate filling, they definitely fulfill any chocolate craving you might have.  Of course, with so much chocolate jammed in, each little cookie (much smaller than you'd expect) has 75 calories in it.  So it is probably best to share a pack of these with friends, rather than give in to temptation and eat a big handful.While the taste is amazing, the cookies are ridiculously messy.  They literally fell apart in my hands when I picked them up out of the container.  The fudge filling is so soft and liquidy that it has the consistency of chocolate syrup rather than fudge sauce.  Using something so fluid as the center of the cookie seems like a way to guarantee they won't hold their shape.  Add to that the fact that the solid cookie part is extremely crumbly and the chocolate chips have a tendency to fall off, and you've got a recipe for disaster.  These cookies are without a doubt the messiest I've ever eaten.  I lost more to the floor and my shirt than I managed to get into my mouth.  I want a cookie that I can pack in my lunch or grab and snack on easily.  These certainly don't meet those needs.  Despite their amazing taste, they aren't worth the clean-up effort."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"There really isn't a lot to say about Chips 's new Chewy Gooey megafudge cookies.  The cookies are indeed soft and chewy but really nothing special. I've tasted better and worse.Not something I personally would go out and purchase but if you are in the market for a soft cookie, this may be to your liking."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Chips  new cookies are really not gooey or even mega fudge. Many other cookies are far more fudgey and far more gooey. They are okay to eat, if you do not mind a slight grainy texture. I did receive these on a warm 90+ degree day and tried them immediately, they were much better warm - like right out from the oven. The packaging is also done well, even after shipping there was very little breakage, which means these would travel well, and since they really aren't all that gooey they are not quite as messy as some others.Two cookies are about 150 calories, quite a lot for a cookie such as this, there is also 7 grams of fat and  110 mg of sodium, 21 g of carbohydrates. You need to weigh! the diet choices and decide if these are worth all of that to you. Personally I do not think these will be on my future shopping list."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies have a disc of ""fudge"" in the center, which feels grainy, and tastes artificial/plasticy.  The are not particularly soft, and they do not taste as good as the normal ""Chips "" pre-made cookies.  The ""dough"" tastes more artificial, and you cannot taste the white chocolate chips at all, as the entire this is overpowered by the ""fudge"" in the middle.I am not a HUGE fan of pre-made/artificial cookies, but I have found the pre-made Chips  brand's normal chocolate chip cookies to be tasty in the past.  So I am going to say that just this new product is lacking something, and not the brand itself.2 stars."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are really not that.  They are large and securely packaged in a re-closeable package.  However, they are not really chewy, just sorta crumbly. Gooeyness seems to imply that they are hot from the oven or short from loads of butter, and I didn't find them to possess that quality. They taste of cheap chocolate and the chips are not any different in flavor from the dough part.  They might be gooier if you left them in a hot car or something.  If you like this brand then you might like them, otherwise I would choose something else."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"As a choco-holic, I'll pretty much eat anything with the word ""chocolate"" on it. While I haven't had any Chips  cookies for a long time, I was excited to have a chance to try out with tasty-sounding little fudge cookies. Sadly, when I got them they were incredibly warm from the brutal Texas summer, so I had to stashed them in the refrigerator for a while, so my first experience with these cookies was chilled.And..they were good, delicious and very rich and decadent. It's basically a chocolate cookie with some fudgy stuff in the center, complete with a handful of chocolate chips infused with the entire thing. These things are like rich sugar incarnate, which isn't a bad thing, except that after about two cookies they become so rick that you just can't stomach them anymore.Then there's the fact that these cookies taste very processed and smeared in preservatives, so they can come off a little ""fake"" tasting.But the biggest letdown? just 2 cookies are 150 calories. Yeah, seriously.Probably the best part of this was the new resealable package, which makes life much easier -no clips or ziploc bags needed to keep the cookies fresh.This may work for children or some people, but I just couldn't get fully into these. I'd rather spend my money on something else..."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Our household is divided on the subject of these cookies.  My short review would be ""Ok, not great, super chocolately but a little dry and processed-tasting.""  My daughter's, on the other hand, was ""Too much of a good thing turns out to be disgusting.""These are Chips  chewy-style cookies with chocolate turned up to 11.  They have chocolate flavored dough, chocolate chips, and a fudge center.  They come in the Chips  resealable pack, where you can pull back a flap on the top, then re-close it and let the post-it style glue hold it closed.What I liked:- These are very chocolatey.  I might prefer them to a regular Chips , just for the intensity of the chocolate experience.- They stay pretty soft and chewy.What could have been better:- These are currently pretty pricey.  I think you can do a lot better if you are willing to spend more than four dollars per pack of cookies.- They are very dry.  Have a glass of milk ready.- They taste a little processed.  Although they are soft and super chocolatey, there's a preservative taste to them that's just a little off.- My daughter is an extreme chocolate fan and likes Chips , so she was excited to try these, but stopped after one.  In her opinion, it's too much chocolate per cookie, and too machine processed.  (The three star rating is my opinion - she would probably give the cookies one star)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"From the moment I first opened these Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies I knew my time with this cookie would be short. Two main reasons - I have a sweet-tooth and as soon as my wife got home these cookies would become an endangered species.Yes, these Chewy Gooey cookies are that good. No, probably not as good as grandma's secret fudge cookie recipe that's been handed down in your family for generations. But when compared to similar national cookie brands they're delish! The cookies themselves are slightly smaller than the traditional Chips ! Chocolate Chip cookies we've all had. The texture of the cookies was a bit less gooey than I expected given the title but seven seconds in the microwave took care of that problem! These cookies are a pleasant combination of salty and sweet which was also a bit surprising but I found it to my liking.The package itself is smaller than I expected and I wish I could comment on how many cookies come in a sleeve. Unfortunately some items are probably better bought in store rather than shipped. My cookies arrived mostly in crumbles and only a few of the cookies resembled anything like an actual cookie. Compliments to Nabisco on the packaging which opens on top and is resealable.All in all I found these cookies deliciously chocolaty though I would probably not purchase them from Amazon."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"My 10 year old son loves chocolate but wasn't particularly impressed by these cookies. For a Chips  product, they are good, but there's still a ""manufactured cookie"" quality to it, versus a small batch or homemade quality. The base cookie is not dry, but spongey. There are 2 kinds of chips that have a nice sweet taste that go good together. The main issue I found is the claim it is gooey. I think that's an overstatement. While there is a small amount of fudge goo in the middle, it doesn't make the whole cookie gooey. If anything, a moderate sensation of gooeyness is produced once you chew the entire cookie in your mouth, but it's nowhere near, say, a chocolate fudge brownie. These are more light and soft, not thick and gooey."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Sorry, but I can't say too many good things about this product.  First of all, the texture is like cardboard; either that or my package was stale.  Second of all, they have the most unnatural taste of any cookie I've ever eaten.  I expected better on this as the regular Chips  aren't too bad.  And it wasn't soft and gooey inside, it was dry and hard."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Both my husband and I are dark chocolate fans, so this cookie looked quite tempting.At first bite, we both got a favorable impression: chewy (not as gooey as advertised, for which I was thankful, as gooey is not a favorite of mine), with a rich dark chocolate taste. My husband is a fan of white chocolate while I am not, so he found the chips a welcome treat.However, along with being chewy, the cookies have a grainy quality, and, to my taste, are excessively sweet. They also leave a rather heavy aftertaste in your mouth which is not pleasant.Coupled with the fact that you only get about 18 cookies for $4.50, I would take a pass on these. Only recommended for those who like their chocolate cookies very sweet."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Chip's  Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are the latest addition to the family of Chip's  cookies.  The picture on the front shows a soft cookie gently being split in two with gooey chocolate oozing out.  Random chocolate chips, both dark and white are scattered about.  Should be chocolicious.The cookies aren't bad.  There was no discernible liquid goo in the center, but more of a sensation of slightly underbaked cookie.  The texture is OK, it definitely is a very strong chocolately flavor, and overall will satisfy the need for a chocolate cookie.  If you have no other options.Generally, a homemade cookie will beat out a packaged cookie every time.  So, lets just compare this cookie to other packaged cookies.  Nothing holds a candle to Oreo's because they are in a class all by themselves.  Compared to the rest of the cookies out there, these are pretty good (note 3 star rating).They are packaged in an extremely noisy resealable package, ostensibly to keep them fresh.  You won't be sneaking anything out of this package, in fact, don't go looking for one in the middle of the night because you'll wake up your whole household, and possibly your neighbors.  The reseal option is nice, keeps them safely contained and might add to the freshness.  With the number of preservatives listed on the label, not sure if freshness will be an issue.Overall, not bad, not great.  Kids will love them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"""Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge;"" I liked these cookies; however, they are a little on the too much chocolate for me. With that statement said, if you love chocolate then you will really like these. If you want less chocolate one cookie is enough and summer time put them in the frig and eat cold."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"A lot of people have already reviewed these cookies, so I will add try to keep my comments succinct.These ""cookies"" to my taste are really more of a moist brownie.  They have the texture and taste of a brownie.  If you like brownies, you'll probably like these.  If you don't, you probably won't.  They are moist, rather than dry and brittle, and I found that to be a plus.At 150 calories per two cookies, megafudge may mega-size your butt in no time.  However, you don't select something entitled ""gooey megafudge"" because you are calorie conscious.  Eaten in moderation and coupled with strenuous exercise, you can probably consume these cookies and still live to near your life expectancy.My one caveat for the chocoholic was the condition I received my product.  The cookies had received rough handling and had virtually crumbled.  My box didn't ship well and I think that is probably due to the softness of the cookie.  Since anyone purchasing the product from here needs to have it shipped, this might be a consideration.Three stars, one star lost for being uninspired and one deducted for the poor condition of the food item after shipping.  Recommended with reservations."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"My husband is a big chocolate fan and he loves his cookies.  I like choclate chip cookies with white chocolate in them, so these sweet and chewy cookies are a nice compromise.  I like the crunch, he loves the fudgy center, that, when slightly chilled, make the cookies even more delicious.The package arrived rather abused, but that was perhaps because for a week our mail was on hold while we had to evacuate for a wildfire.  These cookies still get crumbly and on a hot day the gooey dough make them even  stick together like one sculptured chocolate piece of art.These are definitely a winner, and any chocolate lover will give these two sticky-gooey thumbs up."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The Megafudge Chips  Gooey cookie is delicious! It is soft and sweet, and just the right amount of gooey center.You definitely can't eat just a few of these. Pour yourself a cold glass of milk and get a stack of these cookies. They are heavenly."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love chocolate, and I love cookies, so I was excited to try these cookies.  I was particularly looking forward to a gooey center filled with fudge, as depicted by the large picture on the package.  I was disappointed.  There is a thin, disc-shaped chocolate-colored center in these cookies, but it is certainly not gooey.  Really, it's more like putty, and it doesn't have any discernable chocolate flavor.  The rest of the cookie is chalky in texture and also has no recognizable chocolate flavor.  I did a blind taste test between this chocolate variety and the regular chocolate-chip variety of this new ""gooey"" cookie, and I could not distinguish a difference.  The only difference is the dark brown color of the cookie.  Personally, I prefer the regular, old fashioned Chips  cookies over this new gooey version."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"My first impression of the taste of these cookies was that it wasn't what I expected. I expected a definitive chocolate taste, but it wasn't that. It wasn't bad, but it was different enough that I wasn't sure I liked it. The next bite was better, and the third was pleasing enough that I found myself eating a couple cookies before I stopped.That said, the taste leaves something to be desired. It has a bit of a manufactured flavor. If given the choice between three of these or one homemade cookie, I'd still go for homemade. My four-year-old daughter wouldn't eat these cookies at all--which is saying something, because she normally loves chocolate.The positives about this cookie are the texture (soft as advertised), the fudge filling, and the packaging. The packaging deserves a special note as it is a neat design, I think. Easy to reseal with little mess. And it does keep the cookies soft.The negative is the taste. Passable, palatable, but still a far cry from homemade."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"As a big fan of Chips  chocolate chip cookies, both the original and the chewy, I was prepared to love these as well. Now, like most people, I'm also pretty enthusiastic about chocolate, and theoretically, there is simply no such thing as ""too much."" But it just didn't taste right here. It seemed like there was both too much chocolate, and like the existing chocolate was too processed. Overall, it was a rather disappointing experience. I won't be buying these anytime soon."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"As one could surmise by my other reviews, I'm much more into fitness than I am into high-calorie snacks. That is not to say I don't snack once in a while. That being said, I wouldn't choose these cookies for a snack. They're unbelieveably high in fat and calories and surprisingly not really that good.They're crumbly and dry. Where's the gooey? If I was going to waste some of my calorie intake on this, I want some satisfaction, which I just didn't get.The flavor is a good chocoalte flavor, but none of the expected goo. There are some great chocolate cookies out there. These are not them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Being a fan of all things chocolate, I was looking forward to trying these new Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies! However, they have been a major disappointment. I have tried them at different days and different times, before and after meals, and as snacks, and every time I had the same reaction: a flat and over-processed (if not borderline unnatural) taste. On top of that, each cookie is 75 calories. These are small cookies, around 2-inches diameter each.The package is resealed at the top, with no extra material to throw away. Each package contains 18 cookies, in three rows of six cookies each.It's one thing to take the calorie hit for something really yummy, it's another to take a calorie hit for something that doesn't even taste good!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I love chocolate cookies, and these were VERY good.  The sweetness is not overwhelming and the fudge in the middle is not excessive.  Soft, chewy cookies that go perfectly with an afternoon cup of tea."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"As other reviewers mentioned, these cookies are very high in calories.  That wouldn't be a problem if they tasted good, but sadly the chocolate flavor is very fake.Its a good idea, but the flavor is just very poor.  If you want to eat something chocolatey, just grab some actual chocolate, it tastes way better and is probably less calories."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The white chocolate chips add an extra dimension that takes this cookie to another level!  The chocolate cookie taste is good, the creamy center has a great texture and flavor, and I didn't feel these were to cloyingly sweet as some creamy cookies tend to be.  In fact, the cookie portion itself was a bit crumbly, but it wasn't a turnoff.The cream did have a slight odd crunch to it, which I'm assuming was the edible barrier to keep the creme from soaking into the cookie (I have noticed this same odd crunch in other creme-filled snacks as of late, which makes me think it's a normal manufacturing technique).Serving Size: 2 cookiesPer serving: 150 calories, 7g fat (3.5g saturated), 0g cholesterol, 110mg sodium, 80mg potassium,  21g carbs (13g sugar, >1g fiber), 1g proteinOverall, these are fairly decent for a storebought packaged cookie.  I don't usually buy storebought cookies, actually, we prefer homemade, but everyone in my house enjoyed these!  I don't usually like regular Chips  at all, I don't enjoy the flavor or the very crunchy texture.  But these Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are much better, and have changed my opinion of the brand."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I got to try both the Megafudge and Chocofudge version of this Chips  offering, and of the two, the Megafudge is better.  The white chocolate chunks almost cut the too-sweetness of the cookies so they're tolerable, but they're still too much sweetness in one little cookie.  Plus, these don't travel/ship any better than the Megafudge version does.  My package looked like most of the cookies inside went a round with a rock tumbler and were all broken up, if not crumbed completely.  That's not why I'm giving one grudging star to this product.  It's because for anyone over the age of eleven, these things are going to put you into sugar shock, and they don't even taste good enough to be worth it.  They have an odd Play-Doh-but-sweet taste.  The texture is sort of chewy, but I failed to recognize ""gooey"" in these cookies- maybe on a hot day, or if they spent a few seconds in the microwave.  But they're just not worth the effort.  If you have to go to such great lengths to make a sub-mediocre packaged cookie palatable enough to eat, you could have baked yourself up some slice'n'bakes at the very least, and had something that better approximates a real cookie, with real fresh-from-the-oven chewiness and adequate gooiness. Skip these!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Your kids will be happy to eat these, but of course, they aren't exactly the most discerning eaters.  Calling them ""megafudge"" is sort of a joke.  They taste like mediocre chocolate, without much fudge, and the supposedly soft center is small enough to be barely noticeable.  The small size of the cookies makes portion control easy, which is probably important to you, and when you sneak a cookie for yourself, you won't get a tooth-breaking biscuit.  Amazingly, the resealable packaging actually works.  Again, though, kids will eat almost anything with enough sugar, so there is no need for high expectations with a product like this."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I had high hopes for these Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies. What could be better than soft chocolate cookies filled with white chocolate chips and a fudge center? Turns out, a lot of things! These cookies are quite gooey, as promised (the fudge center is soft and reminds me a bit of chocolate frosting), and they have a very strong chocolaty flavor (good, since they're supposed to be fudgy). However, they also have a strong processed flavor. They remind me of the Grandma's brand cookies you find in a vending machine except on a much smaller scale. (Some people will really appreciate this, but I always thought Grandma's cookies tasted way too processed. I guess I'm a homemade cookie snob!)I'd say stick to regular Chips  and get your soft chocolate cookies somewhere else!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Where to begin...Ok, anytime food shows up as something I could request, try out, and review, I'm likely to jump on the opportunity.  Seriously, do I look stupid?!  Free food?!  What's not to like?!Well, I guess I shouldn't be quite so quick to ask that last question.Ah, now, let me slow down here a bit.  These aren't bad cookies, but they also weren't quite as good as I hoped.First up, I claim a little creative embellishment must be happening with the marketing folks and the pictures on the package.  ""Mega fudgy"" centers?!  Yeah there's some noticable amount there, but gooey? Not so much.  More like noticably softer and more fudge like than the cookie which encases it, but not melty and gooey like shown on the package.Second, the cookies themselves were fairly dry.  That could be a fault of the shipping, but I really don't think so, despite the warmer weather I'd been experiencing in my area.  It hadn't been that warm, and if the package was as well sealed (factory sealed) as it should have been, it shouldn't have succumb to the weather that easily.Third on my list the packaging -- not the marketing photos on the package, but the ""resealable"" package, bleh!  I liked the older style resealable packages that folded over and had folding tabs to reseal the packages.  The new ""peel back"" the package stuff doesn't seem nearly as trustworthy as the older style packages were and in reality seemed to be designed to make me just rip the package open.  Heaven's forbid any of the females in the household (or soon to be in the household as a change of life situation is pending for me, with a fiance that brings a daughter in tow along with her, to join myself and my live-in daughter in the house) be experiencing ones of those demanding times when chocolate is absolutely necessary.  If that were to happen I could see this packaging being easily ripped open completely in favor of getting quick access to the chocolate treasures inside.So, I've gotta ding the product on the packaging, the overly optimistic marketing photos and the dryness of the actual cookies and instead of being well above the medium level, well, this one settles back into mediocre territory."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"What is this compulsion to continually re-invent a successful product? The original crisp Chips ! cookies are my favorites. The softer version is okay, but these soft, dark chocolate cookies with a supposedly fudge filling are over-the-top sweet; the fudge filling tastes artificial. I would prefer this cookie not have a ""fudge"" filling. It would be much improved that way."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love chocolate and I love cookies, but not these cookies. True, they are chewy and gooey, but they just don't taste like real chocolate. About 1/2 of the cookies were broken when we received them in the mail, making them quite a mess. Several people tried them, and the general consensus was, ""they are OK, taste kind of odd, and wouldn't order them again""."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Okay so these are chocolate cookies with white chocolate chips and supposedly a fudgy center.  WOW are these sweet.  I love my chocolate, and my favorite things to eat are toll house chocolate chip cookies.  These are no comparison to toll house.  With their pasty chemical flavor and overly sweet taste I can only imagine little kids going bonkers over these cookies.  In addition, the fudge center wasn't very much like fudge, instead it made the whole cookie soggy feeling.I really didn't care for these cookies, the damp texture along with the overwhelming sweetness and the high fat and preservative content let me know that they weren't for me."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are not the worst but definitely not the best cookie on the shelf.  They are dry with a strange chemical taste that is almost but not totally masked by the chocolate flavoring.  Sending them out away from me to sea would be a far better choice than welcoming them into my home.  High calorie, low flavor.  The re-seal package design is handy and a change but not really an improvement on the original design.  All in all, not worth the money."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Talk about chocolate overload! Chewy Gooey Megafudge Chips  cookies are definitively chewy and there is is real gooey stuff inside! My kids' only complaint was that the package should hold more cookies! The resealable package is easy to open and reseals very well. If you love chocolate chocolate chips cookies, and want even more gooey chocolate taste in the inside, try these!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"We received these delicious cookies in the mail and were pleased with the packaging and freshness of the product. Easy to open package, the cookies were setting carefully inside compartments to avoid excessive bumps with other cookies. Containing blended pieces of chocolate chips, the chocolate dough was well flavored, and the cookies were chewy, easy on the teeth, and quite tasty. Just a nice chocolatey experience for all ages.Aside from a little bit of a strong aftertaste, the flavor was solid and appealing. The aftertaste was less pleasant and reminded me a little of generic, artificial flavoring used in most processed foods of today. Although not excessive, there were many crumbs left from the cookies and each one needed gentle handling to avoid falling apart. This quality likely allows for the soft, chewy feeling but has the potential to be a crumbly mess if the eater is not careful.Good price, good eating, and lots of fun, this is highly recommended for a quick, comfortable dessert. Maybe the overall flavor and approach is more appealing to a younger generation than older although the soft idea is appropriate for all ages. Yet anyone seeking a chocolate cookie, will be pleased with the result as the cookie practically melts with chocolate joy in the mouth."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I'd like to note that this is the first time I have ever ordered food over the internet.  The cookies arrived undamaged and healthy (as far as I could tell), but seeing as they're just cookies (cookies with many preservatives in them) its probably one of the easiest foods to ship.-The gooey megafudge cookies were tasty, but there was a lot less fudge inside than I expected, and it wasn't as 'gooey' as expected.  It was a bit more solid ... you could definitely tell the difference between the cookie and the fudge, but don't expect it to ooze everywhere.  This could be because the cookies were shipped and thus were not as fresh as normal, I'm not sure.Overall they're OK cookies.  While it is impressive that Nabisco got a ""gooey"" center in there the cookies themselves were a bit dry and not especially tasty.  They certainly weren't bad, but if you need a quick cookie fix you should probably look elsewhere unless you must have a ""gooey"" center.  I didn't try dunking them in milk, that may have helped a bit ... it usually does.  But, if a cookie needs to be dunked for optimal taste it hasn't really succeeded as a cookie in my book."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Nothing better than a soft gooey cookie. Here's a tip.  Pop it in the microwave for about 5 seconds and it's now warm too!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies were a huge hit in our house. I normally avoid fudge filled or coated cookies because I find them too sweet. These new Chips  Gooey megafudge cookies are so good I could not resist. They ARE very sweet, but it's that lucious, need to have another one, who cares about that diet! sweetness. These are soft and not in the least bit crunchy and they have what I think are white chocolate slivers in them along with a layer of fudge inside. We'll totally look for these at the grocery store in the future!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Roughly 18 cookies are contained in the 10 ounce package. Each cookie has 75 calories and 6.5g of sugar. These are fairly small cookies, each about the size of a Fig Newton, although round. The appearance of the cookie is chocolate with white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate bits mixed in. Consistency is soft with occasional hard bits. My expectation from a ""Chewy Gooey"" cookie was for a moist shell surrounding truffle-like inner content. In some ways, given the appearance, I expected the cookie to taste like a soft version of an Oreo's exterior. But the actual cookie is somewhat dry, and while the small center is soft, I would not go so far as to describe it as Gooey.The package also describes the cookie as megafudge, but the taste was more artificial than I would expect from the description. Oddly, it was more artificial than I would expect given the ingredients (which include cocoa). So we've got a cookie which is less moist than one would desire and which tastes mildly artificial. The artificial taste is not bad, but is more Pillsbury Chocolate Space Food Stick than, say, an Oreo, which actually does taste like it has cocoa but which has artificial flavor.By this point, I'm sure you're wondering whether I'm the right person to be reviewing a cookie. I do, in fact, like cookies. I even like ordinary Chips  cookies and have a particular fondness for fresh Toll House cookies right out of the oven. These cookies, however, let me down. Family members concurred."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These rich cookies are dark chocolate, lightly filled with  a soft bite of chocolate, and interlaced with some white bits.  They are very tasty, and of a neat, small, non-crumbling size that would be good on a cookie tray for an event such as a shower, reception, etc., besides being fine for general-purpose cookie nibbling."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Even though these soft, fudge-filled cookies verge on overkill (nothing wrong with good ol' standard Chips ), I like them a lot. I wouldn't recommend eating half a package at once, but if you are able to limit yourself to two cookies they aren't going to cause too much harm. Well, stay away from them if you are dieting I guess.They aren't that 'chewy' as the product name indicates. They are soft, somewhat crumbly chocolate-chocolate chip cookies. It's easy to over-indulge because you can easily pop a whole cookie in your mouth at once. So it's probably best not to go overboard. The 'gooey' part has to do with the chocolatey filling - there is a thin layer in the cookie.The package is kind of nice, with an easily resealable top that pulls open."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are just okay. They are soft-textured, and kids might enjoy them. They are not ""megafudge"" by any means. People who love chocolate would not like the artificial chocolate taste of the cookie or the filling. After having sampled this product, I would not purchase it at a store."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The soft Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies arrived today and were treated to a three person review;  * Our six year old grandson,who is a very picky eater, quickly ate his and when asked said it was good...3 out of 5 stars...but too chocolately.  * My husband,who loves chocolate, ate one and said, ""If you added a second one it would become a very yummy fudgey brownie....and if you added a third it would be even better"". Unfortunately the third one made it a way too sugary experience, but knowing 2 at a time is his limit, he is more than willing to go buy some more at the store (and he only rarely buys store bought cookies). He gives these a 5 out of 5 stars.  * I,who am on a diet and hardly ever eat cookies, found the two I ate yummy, but not chewy. I liked the combination of all the different chocolates - white, fudge, semi sweet. They are just the right size for 1 or 2 cookies at a time and 3 is too, too much! They are a soft cookie and I really prefer a crunchy cookie over a soft oneso I will give them 4 out of 5 stars.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2"">Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge, 10-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I like 'em.  Very rich chocolate flavor.  Taste quite good.  I gave four stars, because I prefer cookies not quite so soft, but a bit firmer.  However, that's just my preference.  As I said, for the flavor, really quite good."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I have had the regular chewy cookies before and enjoyed those.  My husband loves them and had not seen this type in the store before.  I must say that I did enjoy the brownie like cookie with fudge center.  These cookies are almost to soft to a fault.  They break very easily but are very soft, not brittle.  I enjoyed this wonderful soft cookie.  This cookie will be a snack for the long haul at my house.  My boys, husband, and I loved them.  When school starts in the fall..this will be a lunch desert for sure!  I also liked the white chocolate chips added to the cookie!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies are very soft, chewable, and delicious! The only problem I had with them is that each cookie is pretty tiny, so I kept eating them. And that means the calories add up in a hurry, as only two of these are 150 calories with 7 grams of fat.  There's almost no way to eat only two.  I don't know if they're quite ""gooey"" as the label claims, but they are quite good."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The Chips  Chewy Gooey Megafudge Cookie is a good attempt at a cookie. The only thing I would change is leave out the white chocolate chips as they taste chaulky, and do not add anything to the taste of the cookie. The fudge is a nice touch and the taste of the rest of the cookie is just fine."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love almost anything chocolate.  But these were a bit too sugary for me.First, the packaging is really neat.  You can open the package and peel back the cover as far as you need to get to the cookies.  Then you simply reseal the package and it keeps the cookies fresh.I was a little disappointed with the taste.  They are soft-baked and do have an ample amount of chocolate chips and white chocolate chips in each cookie.  But the taste of sugar is a bit too strong for my taste.  As has been noted, the cookies are very high in calories - 150 for two cookies.Also the cookies were smaller than I had expected.It is extremely difficult to review food products because taste vary so much by individual.  You may love them.  I found them acceptable but not outstanding.  It all depends on your particular taste.  For me they were a bit too sweet and they are certainly very high in calories."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Wow--these new Chips  cookies are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  When they say ""Megafudge"" on the outside of the package, they aren't kidding.  It's a burst of deep, dark chocolate flavor in every soft, chewy bite.  I wouldn't say they're ""gooey;"" that's probably more of a marketing tactic, but they are definitely soft and chewy.  They remind me of the old Archway dutch chocolate cookies but with more chocolate flavor and moistness.I would definitely recommend them if you're looking for something sweet and chocolate-y.  It was difficult to stop at eating just one.  So I stopped with two."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The texture of these cookies is odd, almost a plastic like feel.  They did eventually get eaten, which is why I gave it three stars, but in a house with three kids, it's not hard to imagine cookies of any quality being eaten."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I like the resealable package - but unfortunately I opened on the wrong side - my bad :(The cookies look good - they taste pretty good - slightly weird processed salty taste - or maybe just not as sweet as I am used to - can't decide if that is good or bad.  Nice texture."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"If I am going to consume 150 calories in two small chocolate cookies, they had better be GOOD.  These cookies are not, at all.  I suppose if you like the original chips 's somewhat processed taste you might like these as well.  Not recommended."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I wouldn't call the middle ""gooey"". I would say it is ""creamy"". I really liked this dark version. It does not seem as sweet as the regular chocolate chip with a ""gooey"" middle. The chocolate cookie balances out the sweetness. They were what I would call ""fudgey"" in flavor and texture. The only ""odd"" thing I noticed about these is that there is a wafer-like texture in the middle of the cookie (beneath the cookie covering and on top of the creamy center). It was a little strange at first, but then I adjusted.My kids liked these a little better than the other version (regular chocolate chip) of this cookie, but all in all this is not their favorite Chips  cookie. They preferred the traditional cookie. They did not like the flavor or the texture of these. I'm sure some kids will love them, mine did not."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Imagine...chocolate with more chocolate with a side of chocolate.Soft cookie kinda a brownie type, chocolate fudge filling, and chocolate chips..the only thing it was missing was ME and a scoop of vanilla ice-cream (I was outof chocolate...or it would of definitely been a death by chocolate evening...LOL)I dunno...I am thinking this might be something special enough to put up on theHIGH shelf in the kitchen.  Excellent little treat, now the hard part is going tobe limiting myself!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"First I have read concerns about shipping cookies. I will start with saying that the packages of cookies arrived intact. Now on to the cookies themselves, they are not very good tasting cookies. These taste like synthetic chocolate fudge chip cookies that left a linger aftertaste that was not pleasant. I do not know how Nabisco would place their ""Chips "" brand name on these. I do not buy this sort of snack because I am watching calories, but each cookie is seventy-five calories. A positive note is that they have packaged these cookies in their new self sealing packaging. I do not recommend these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Chips ! is probably the best-selling chocolate chip cookie in the United States, and I have always thought it was one of the worst.  I've never been a fan of hard chocolate chip cookies and Chips ! was always the cookie of last resort for me.  Now, though, Chips ! has launched two new soft chocolate chip cookies:  the one under review here (Megafudge) and Chocofudge.  I think they are both pretty good, but I think the Chocofudge is better.  The Megafudge, as the name implies, is basically white and dark chocolate chips in a chocolate fudge cookie.  It's not bad, but a little too much chocolate for my taste.  So, if you are thinking of trying one of these Chips ! cookies, you shouldn't be too disappointed with either one, but I would go with the Chocofudge.  Actually, of the mass produced chocolate chip cookies, I like the Pepperidge Farms soft baked Nantucket chocolate chip cookie best."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Not only did I find these replusive, but so did my family members.  The fudge part is tolerable, but the chocolate has a funny taste, almost like hot chocolate powder that didn't get stirred in when you make hot chocolate.  Definitely would not buy at the store.  One cookie was more than enough."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are only OK. The texture is fine, but the flavor is quite bland, not nearly as chocolatey as I expected given that the cookie itself is chocolate as well as the filling. Despite the name, the filling is not particularly gooey, but I don't consider that to be a drawback. As noted on the package, these cookies are soft - very soft. Often, I find that soft cookies tend to stick together in the package, then break apart when you try to separate them. These cookies, however, did hold together fairly well.The cookies come in the resealable package, which I like very much.I probably wouldn't buy these cookies in the store because the flavor was so bland."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"All the members of my extended family partook from the review cookies and I would say all of them ate more than one.  My sister-in-law said, ""not bad for a grocery store cookie"".  I caught my daughter on a raid of the cookies at 10pm later that evening.  I found that they melt in the mouth quite well and do live up to their name.  If I was going to buy grocery store cookies, I would buy Chips !  Chewy Gooey Megafudge and serve them with pride!  Thanks guys, from all of us."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are a huge disappointment as a new product offering from Nabisco.  The cookies have an awful fake chocolate flavor, and the they are chalky tasting and dry.  There was nothing gooey about the center of the cookie.  It was more of the same dry, grainy taste as the ""cookie"" part.  And at 150 calories for 2 cookies (which are less than 2 inches in diameter) they are not worth eating.  They have 7 grams of fat in two small cookies, of which 3.5 is saturated fat, coming from coconut and palm oils.I will however, give credit to Nabisco for two things.  They did load the cookies with a lot of white chocolate chips so they certainly did not skimp on that ingredient, and the resealable package is a great idea.  The opening for the package pulls apart from the top, and there is a sticky type substance that hold the wrapper in place once you reseal it.  I would not consider it air tight, but it certainly makes a good seal for the package.  I can not recommend these cookies based on the taste, texture, and high caloric intake per small serving size.  I will not be buying these cookies again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I am a sucker for all things chocolate, and fudge-anything is even more decadently delicious. I jumped at the chance to try these new Chips  cookies and was extremely disappointed when I didn't like them. The cookie is very similar to those large Grandma's two-pack Fudge Choco-Chip you get from vending machines, but with a fudge-like stuff cocooned in the middle and surrounded by a thin crispy substance (may be sugar, may be white chocolate?).In describing them, they sound delish, but my first-bite impression is a processed and overly-salty flavor that hides the chocolate goodness. At 150 calories every 2 cookies, I'd rather get my choco-fix from a Hershey bar.On the plus side, the new resealable package is great, and keeps you from having to slide the tray out to access a couple of cookies, much less messy!I'm sure there are people that love these, but in my opinion, if you're looking for real old-fashioned fudge flavor, these won't satisfy."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge / B004U49QU2I received these cookies and their non-chocolate counterparts at the same time, and I'm a little disappointed with both.I was skeptical that packaged cookies would be soft, but these cookies actually are very soft around the edges. Unfortunately, the mouth-feel is very unpleasant to me: they feel a little like wet bread in my mouth. Once the edges have fallen off, you hit the center core of fudge -- it's basically a hard chocolate disk inside the cookie that needs warming for a second or two in the microwave beforehand.These aren't the worst cookies I've ever eaten, but I didn't enjoy them at all and really wanted to throw them away after the first few had been eaten -- there's a strange aftertaste that I don't much care for. There's also a bit of a ""fake chocolate"" smell to the cookies that is unpleasant -- my husband took one sniff of each package and refused to try any, saying that they ""smelled bad"".I really like the idea these cookies represent, and I hope that Chips  can get the recipe right in their next attempt -- it's a good idea, but just doesn't quite come together in execution.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Well, I wouldn't really call these soft cookies ""gooey"", but they are chewy and plenty chocolatey.In short, I think these will appeal to chocoholics who don't mind the host of chemical additives listed in the ingredients.If I'm understanding Amazon's pricing correctly, however, each 10-ounce package costs a little more than $4.Zowie -- a family of chocoholics can easily devour that package in one brief sitting.Well, as the French, say: ""chacun a son 'goo'""..."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I believe they wanted this cookie to taste like a brownie. I am so used to Chips  having that subtle choco flavor with a crisp bite that this cookie surprised me. It is gooey as stated on the package but the texture is awful. Enough for me and my daughter not to finish our cookies. We love cookies so you know that this was not a good one if we did not finish it! The taste is not a brownie taste. Can't even explain it. I am sure they are trying to branch out with more choices but how did this one pass their focus groups??"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I must admit that I was really excited to try these cookies.  I love Chocolate.  What could be better than extra ooey, gooey chocolate, right?Honestly, I was not impressed.  They seem dry and kind of fake tasting.  They aren't horrible but definitely not as good as they sounded.  I think I will stick with regular Chips  from now on."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I will never buy these cookies at the grocery store.  They just have a very chemical taste and the very strange texture."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"My husband and I are chocoholics. The minute I saw the word ""megafudge"" I envisioned rich, gooey chocolate melting in my mouth. Sadly, this was not the case. The cookies taste rather dry, they aren't particularly sweet and each one left a strange chalky aftertaste in my mouth. The texture is more like cookie dough than fudge. The little white chocolate chips sprinkled into each cookie don't have any flavor to them. If you had told me these were reduced fat cookies, like SnackWells, I would have believed you. Since they're not, I'd rather indulge in something that actually tastes good since my waistline will be paying for it!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies are small, and initially taste good but then after you swallow you realize there's an odd aftertaste.  It's a strong chemical, preservative type flavor.  The kids wouldn't even eat any more, they said they'd just eat another one to get the fake taste out of there mouth but then they'd have it again.  The chocolate megafudge tastes like burnt coffee or bad grape juice.  They're just awful cookies, very small and lots of calories. Skip these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These new cookies by Nabisco won't be purchased by my wife or I unless there is a special clearance sale.  There is an aftertaste in each bite that left me and my kids wondering if we'd just brushed our teeth.  The gooey center was more like a thin film of fudge, and nothing gushed out like the picture led us to believe.  The cookies are very thin, and not worth the caloric intake."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Nabisco has come out with several good products lately.  This, unfortunately, is not one of them.  I recently tried a crispy cranberry-orange cookie of theirs that was one of the best tasting things I've ever had in my entire life... and I'm OLD (53).  These cookies are surprisingly small in diameter (between 1 1/2 and 2 inches).  I was expecting three inch wide cookies (what I'd consider ""normal"" for this type of product).  In the end though, the size doesn't matter (!) - they just don't taste very good.  I love chocolate, but I'd take those cranberry based cookies any day instead of these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I have never met a cookie I didn't like and this is no exception.  It's loaded with chocolate and is very very soft. It's more like a flattened brownie then a cookie. My only complaint is that it is a high calorie snack per small serving and they are messy, they fell apart when you touch them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The Chips  cookies ARE chewy and gooey (at least a little bit gooey), rather than crunchy. But while they are very chocolaty, they seem to have an artificial chocolate flavor that I did not particularly enjoy. At 75 calories per cookie, there are a lot of other cookies I'd rather spend my calories eating ...I did enjoy the self-closing packaging though, which at least keep the cookies from getting stale."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies taste very yummy!  My whole entire family loves them but I'm not digging the calories.  1 serving size is 2 of these cookies and that is 150 calories so 75 calories per cookie.  They're not very big so it seems pretty high to me.My daughter and I think these cookies taste like a brownie with a yummy fudge filling inside.  I'd agree with the reviewers who state that they aren't very ""gooey"" but regardless they are still really good.If you're not on a diet or concerned about calories then I'd highly recommend these cookies but if you're trying to diet then these cookies may be too much of a temptation.  You may eat more than just 1 or 2 and it can kill a diet."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"""Nabisco Fudge Filled Soft Cookies: CHIPS AHOY! Chewy Gooey Megafudge""  9with both white and chocolate chips) in a lift-resealable package.  At first bite a little dry tasting, each time I started eating I hesitated a bit in liking it initially:  initially a little `crystalic', but once the tongue gets the soft filling - then a very enjoyable chocolate-fudge high rush.  Soft fudgy-choc filling, nice firm chunky choc chips, very rich choc flavors.  Then the cookie hits back of throat - a fine choc-fudge taste is extended! I wanted to wash it down with milk, but I resisted the temptation as I wanted to keep that good, DEEP RICH flavorful choc-fudge taste to `hold'  in the mouth for several minutes.  The cookie's outside is firm, but yet soft - somewhat like a crystallized shell - which once bitten through gets to the forbidden soft Fudge elixir.  After one, I had to down another two in a row.  (disclaimer:  I did receive a free package of this cookie for review.)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I did not enjoy these cookies.  They have a strange, chalky texture and taste and they left a strange aftertaste in my mouth.  It's hard to imagine not liking a chocolate cookie and the description sounds good but these were very disappointing cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm a chocoholic and liked the taste plus the fact that it's a soft cookie.  I barely noticed the fudge in the middle.  I can't eat too many at once since they are so chocolaty.  The easy-to-reseal package was an improvement.  I kept half and gave the rest to my son to take home with him in the package.  He said they made it there ok without spilling and still fresh after a few days.  I might buy these in the future when I need a chocolate rush."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are small, soft, cake-like cookies with a fudgey center. Yes, they're chewy and gooey and boy are they sweet. A bit too sweet for my taste, but my husband, who still has the taste buds of a kid, gives them two thumbs up. Pretty good for a store-bought cookie, and a little bit of an upgrade from regular Chips . Another cool thing is the package that seals itself back up."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"What more could you want in a pre-packaged cookie? These things are soft, moist and rich. The chocolate is very dark and prominent.The package I got had soft not gooey centers. I actually think this is preferable and less messy.My kids love these. This was the ultimate taste test. I asked my 4 year old twins if they liked them more than chocolate chip and they said yes. Now I have another thing to bribe them with to improve their behavior.I like the Chips  resealable packaging - this really helps to keep the soft cookies soft and fresh.The cookies are small, the same size as regular chips . This is good if you're working on portion control."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"When I was a child, I loved chewy Chips  cookies, but when I stopped eating them for a few years and tasted them again, I found them not to be tempting at all.  They had a strange chemical taste that wasn't appealing.  These cookies, while they definitely have a hint of an artificial flavor of some kind, are significantly better, and I recommend them for someone who needs chocolate in a hurry.  The cookie itself is fine - soft enough to be chewy, hard enough that most of the cookies don't fall apart - but the real draw of this new cookie is the chocolate goo in the center.  I tasted five or six cookies in a row, and each one was consistent, with a truly indulgent pool of fudge encased in a delicate crunchy layer, like the candy shell on an M&M.  The contrasting textures in each bite of cookie (chewy cookie, crisp border, then luxurious goo) make for an entertaining snack that pleases the senses.  If the cookie itself had tasted a little more like a homemade cookie, then I would have awarded this product five stars, but what I tasted was definitely worth recommending to any chocolate lover who likes a texturally entertaining sweet."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I love chocolate and so couldn't resist trying these <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2"">Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge, 10-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. Before I received them, I had bought some large brownie-like cookies at Whole Foods and hoped these Megafudge cookies would even outshine those. However, nope, it didn't happen. The Chips ! cookies were smaller than I'd thought from the description, some of their centers didn't taste very gooey and were almost indistinguishable from the outer layer, and they had a slight chemical/manufactured aftertaste. That said, as a chocoholic, this is still a cookie I might buy on occasion, depsite the calories. But perhaps Chips ! could revamp this recipe for a more natural taste? That could tempt me to be a regular customer of this product."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Against my better judgement, I tasted these cookies. My good judgement told me that I might have a problem eating just one. That was very true. I had a problem stopping at three.....These cookies are tasty, with no hidden trans-fats (zero grams doesn't mean that there aren't any, but in this case, there are none). I wouldn't agree that these cookies are actually gooey. They are in fact very soft and have a great chocolate taste. These cookies are very good, and I would buy them again. I just have to figure out how to hide them from myself.  :)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"You can do a lot worse in the category of corporate-branded, machine-stamped, focus-tested, baked-by-the-gazillion cookies. This Chips  variant (and there must be a dozen by now; the brand has been extended from here to Mars) is chewy and rich, compulsively consumable, with a pleasant aroma and authentic-feeling aftertaste. They are smaller than you'd expect, though (which is probably a good thing) and at only 18 to a package you can eat a whole sack, absent-mindedly, between Alex Trebek introducing his contestants and teeing up Final Jeopardy. And whatever that chocolatey fluid is that spills across your tongue as you chew, it's not fudge. It's not bad, but it's not fudge. Fudge doesn't have the viscosity of Pepto-Bismol. ""Megafudge"" is a made-up word for good reason, methinks.The thing is that at 3.5 grams of saturated fat and 75 calories PER COOKIE, you have to consider whether this is the best way to indulge yourself. You can have a big, fresh bakery cookie six inches across instead of gobbling six or eight of these... and almost certainly do less damage.These cookies taste good but they're pretty poor value and nutritionally disastrous."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Wow, I am really loving these cookies. I never thought I would like fudge in a cookie this way. The fudge gives it a ""gooey"" texture, but not too gooey. It's gooey enough to make the cookie soft. The good thing about it is that it's not ""dripping-gooey"". It's solid enough to not drip on your clothes.When I get home from work I'm going to put this in my fudge swirl vanille ice cream and see how that taste. I may update this to tell you about it.Well, if you like fudge, you should definitely like this one. I hope they keep this one around."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I consider myself a cookie expert.  I usually make my own cookies but on occasion when the cupboards are bare I will buy store-bought.  These Chips  are full of chocolate in the filling and the dough.  They taste great in MHO. Two cookies are 150 calories which is somewhat high (since the cookies are somewhat small). That's why I deducted one star.  When I make my own cookies I know the ingredients that go into them.  And my cookies have fewer calories.  But if my cupboards become bare again I would consider buying these in a pinch. :)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I received the cookies today.  The flavor is certainly fudgy, albeit a little on the dry side.  I don't eat a lot of cookies so it may be some preservatives that cause the dryness, but either way it isn't a deal breaker.  The white chocolate chips break up the fudginess well.  The problem is, 2 cookies are 150 calories.  I ate about 7 and that could easily be a decent size meal.  Fat calories per serving are 60 calories, which is not too bad, but these are definitely not for the health conscious.  Still, even with high calories, these are preferable to some low fat alternatives out there, which pack on sugar and salt in fat's place.  Please, just don't go overboard on them if you are concerned about your weight.  7 cookies doesn't seem like a lot, but just think- 7 cookies = 525 calories!  That's the equivalent of a good size burger at a fast food chain."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love chocolate and I love cookies, so this product was perfect for me.  The Chips  Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are all chocolate, with a chocolate fudgy center and white and dark chocolate chips.  They remind me of Soft Batch cookies made by Keebler. The package did not survive long and I would buy them again (and hide them from my family!)  The cookies themselves are not huge, maybe 2"" in diameter,  There were 18 in the lift top, resealable package.  The stats are not great and not horrible for a cookie: 2 cookies 150 cal, 7g fat, 3.5 sat. fat, 13g sugar.  They are an indulgence and a yummy one at that.  Give them a try!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Chips  - Chewy Megafudge Cookies2 cookies/31 gr -150 calories7g fatSat fat  -3.5g110 mg SodiumThis is going to sound a bit like a schizophrenic sort of a  review, since I both liked this product for some aspects and disliked it for others. This product certainly delivers what it claims.  It is rich and fudgy, with a yummy creamy center and nice bits of chocolate pieces, both regular chocolate and white pieces. While you would never ever mistake this for a homemade cookie, it can be an interesting addition to your lunch or a snack.It has a somewhat pleasant taste and texture, but unfortunately, for some reason the initial bite into the first cookie seemed taste `salty' (although by the second cookie that taste seems to disappear).My biggest disappointment is that for such tiny cookies there is such a large caloric intake. The filling could have been a little less creamy and a little more fudge like, since it oozes out of the cookie while biting into it.Delivery via UPS didn't seem to harm the cookies any; at least no more than the typical breakage when buying cookies at the grocery store."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I grew up eating Chips  chocolate chip cookies. They were the only and the best chocolate-chip cookies ever...until I grew up and realized there is better out there. I still enjoy Chips !, but every time I eat them, it's never the same enjoyment I had as a kid. I guess my taste buds grew up.Eating Chips  Megafudge Gooey gives me the same experience. It's luscious in it's own right...the Chips  way. Chips ! Megafudge Gooey is like a chocolate chocolate-chip cookie and brownie hybrid. It eats like a soft cookie, it's tasty like a brownie, and it's fudgy goodness is a mix of both. I love the gooey fudge - that 's what really makes these cookies pop.As usual, these cookies taste best with milk. Kids will probably enjoy these cookies better than the adults who've tasted better and know better. However, there's just something about Chips  cookies that make you come back for more even if it's not the greatest cookie in the world. It's still Chips ! It's the familiar fun snacking cookie that even adults enjoy if you don't take your cookies and chocolate too serious.For Chips ! this deserves 5 stars. I think they really got something yummy here for their brand and I hope they keep it around.However, in comparison to other cookies out there...3 stars. Good but not great. Yummy, but you know there's better out there."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"As my daughter said when she first bit into one, ""Is it even legal for anything to be this good?!""Is it, indeed. A soft, chocolate cookie with soft, fudgy filling. It's a chocolate lover's paradise, and really the only Chips ! cookie I've ever liked to this extent. Though I know they make the soft variety, normally the crispy is in our pantry - mostly because I'm afraid I'd eat all the soft. The crispy just don't do it for me, but this cookie - Oh my God!Chocolate lovers, those who dream of fudge encased in soft, chewy cookie, this is for you. And we will DEFINITELY buy these at the grocery store, though I may have to put a lock on the pantry doors.Excellent!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"As an adult who occasionally enjoys a cookie or two ... or six, I was hoping this new cookie would deliver a satisfying overload of chocolate and texture and become a household staple.  And while I was pleased with some aspects of this particular cookie, it did not meet the standards I was expecting.First of all, if one really wants something named ""Chewy Gooey Megafudge"" to actually taste good, they should skip the calorie counting because, in my opinion, taste has an inverse relationship with calories.  So, nutritional info aside, the overall taste for a mass-packaged soft cookie was quite satisfactory.  I liked the flavor of the chocolate cookie dough in combination with white-chocolate chips and the injected ""fudge"" and although the combination of the three sounds extremely rich, the cookies were not ""heavy"" or overly sweet.  The first cookie easily led to a second ... and then a third, so they did have an addictive quality to them (maybe now caloric intake should be considered).While flavor is important, I predicated my overall satisfaction on other aspects like texture, packaging, value, etc. and I had some issues with the Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies that generated disappointment:1) Texture - for soft cookies, they crumble too much.  It is frustrating to take a bite and have the remainder of the cookie falling apart around the fudge in the middle.  Additionally, the fudge was not gooey, as promised by the name ... it was more like cake icing.2)  Packaging - for the size of the bag, there are relatively few cookies.  My first disappointment was opening the descent-sized bag of cookies only to find the plastic divider tray consuming most of the space ... and relatively few cookies.3) Cookie Size - this was the biggest turn-off.  An addictive chocolate-chocolate chip cookie with fudge filling ... the size of a half-dollar?  C'mon, cookies like this need to be bigger than bite-sized.The lethal combination of tiny cookies and such small quantity (due to the packaging) was more than enough to negate the taste for me. In fact, I `m not sure a cookie-craving moment could be satisfied by a single bag!  Increasing the size of the cookie and putting more of them into the bag would make this product a staple in my household."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies were reviewed my myself and my 7, 5, and 3 year old kids. :)  Although we bake a lot at home, we also buy store bought cookies--including Chips .  I'm not going to compare these to home baked, but to other store bought cookies.These are a good, chocolatey cookie--but the chocolate tastes a little off, which in my experience, is common when the main cookie is chocolate flavored.  They're filled with white and chocolate chips, and then have a chocolate middle.  The middle is not very liquidy--which is good.  I was afraid that it would make a mess, but it didn't.We all liked them--especially with a glass of cold milk.  The kids devoured them--so they're definitely a hit with the under 8 crowd.  I think if you were craving a true chocolate cookie (vs. a chocolate chip), this might fit the bill.  I just wish that the chocolate flavor was a bit better.  In general, I think Pepperidge Farms does better chocolate flavored cookies.  The chocolate on a Nabsico Oreo is also better tasting IMHO.Would buy again--but not destined to be a cravable favorite."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I'm a big chocolate fan and was eager to try out these new cookies!  I was hoping to find something comparable to my all-time favorite packaged cookie: Grandma's Homestyle Fudge Chocolate chip cookies.The Chip's  Chewy Gooey Megafudge is not nearly as good as Grandma's.  They cookies have a pleasant chocolate taste but the ""gooey"" part of the chocolate is actually a bit gritty.  The creaminess I expected wasn't there.  More importantly, these cookies are way too dry.  Even drinking a glass of water with them didn't help.  Grandma's cookies are very moist and with that as my benchmark, these cookies fell short."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies are pretty average chocolate cookies.  The description of chewy and gooey megafudge doesn't really ring true.  The cookies are soft, and have a pleasant, not-too-sweet taste.  They have kind of an odd texture, almost like an oatmeal cookie.  All in all, I would say they are just ok.  Someone expecting decadent fudge taste will be disappointed."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Mmmm, chocolately goodness!  Not only are these Chips  cookies chewy and delicious, but they have creamy fudge inside!  They're quite delectable.  I'd buy more.  The only reason they lose a star is because they don't taste home-baked.  I know, store-bought cookies rarely do, but if they did, that'd make them perfect.Here's the health info: Serving size = 2 cookies. Calories per serving: 150. Calories from fat: 60. Total fat: 7 g.  Carbs: 21g.  Iron: 8% of your daily value.  Does that mean these are good for you?  Niiice.  I love you, Chips !"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These new cookies by the Nabisco/Chip  folks are pretty darn yummy.  Just as the description makes them sound, they are full of chocolate fudge gooeyness and goodness.  ""Megafudge"" may be a bit much though, as I was actually expecting the cookies to be slightly fudgier than they actually were.  Still, they tasted good, and made you want more.  Not sure if they are better than the standard Chips  (which I love), but they definitely fill a hunger gap when you need some chocolate fudge.  Worth a try!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"As part of my participation in the Amazon Vines program, I received a box to review.  My family assisted with this review - quite eagerly in fact.If you love a really strong and rich chocolate cookie, then this is for you.  The ones we received were a bit on the crumbly side, but still delicious.I like lots of chocolate taste in my cookies, so I really enjoyed it.  Overall, I'd give it a 4 from my point of view.My wife liked them, but she felt the chocolate taste kind of overwhelmed it.  She thought it would make a good candidate to dip into a glass of milk or as something to crumble over a bowl of vanilla ice cream.  She said that she'd rate it between a 3 and a 3 and 1/2.Oldest daughter really liked it and ate one of youngest daughter's cookies which started a minor yelling match between the two.  She gives it a 5.Youngest daughter sums it up best.  She came into the kitchen and in her best almost 3 yr old demanding voice said, ""I want more cookie!""Add it all up and it's a definite four."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"""Chewy"" and ""gooey"" don't describe the cookies I received.  They were crumbly and falling apart, and while there was some chocolate flavor, it was overwhelmed with sugar and left a too-sweet aftertaste.  Three stars are an average of one star (from me) and five stars (from my kids).  Ok for the kids' lunch box, I guess, but I'm sticking with the Oreo brand - the mint fudge ones were awesome."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Cookies can be put into three basic buckets (or maybe cookie jars).  There are your homemade cookies, which if you know any semi-decent cooks, are the source of the best cookies.  Then there are the bakery cookies and the store-bought (which is to say, processed and pre-packaged) cookies.  It wouldn't be fair to compare across these buckets as they have different standards, any more than it'd be fair to compare a low-budget horror movie to Citizen Kane.So how do the Chips  Chewey Gooey Megafudge cookies hold up against the competition in the cookie aisle.  Reasonably well.  Obviously, taste is a subjective thing, particularly with foods.  I can explain why I think a particular movie or book is good or bad, but for cookies, it's more difficult.  I liked them, the co-workers I shared them with liked them, and I went back for more than one.  But I've also had better; if I were buying cookies, these would not be my first choice, but I wouldn't refuse them either.  If you like Chips  cookies and you like chocolate, these will be a decent selection."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I am a chocoholic and these have a very nice, chocolatey taste. However, the layer of fudge in the center was a bit skimpy. Not exactly megafudge in my opinion...just fudge. Also, they are extremely crumbly; it was hard to even get them out of the package without breaking. Luckily, they are pretty freaking delicious, which makes up for the skimpy fudge and the crumbs. It was hard to limit myself to one serving, which is 2 cookies and comes in at 150 calories."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"By the picture on the box, I expected these cookies would be larger than what they turned out to be. I didn't really care for their flavor. I thought they tasted pretty artificial, but then again, most cookies sold in supermarkets are made from artificial ingredients. I think I'll pass on this product. Not my kind of snack."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"If you're going to buy cookies and not bake them, then these might be for you.They're soft.They're very chocolate-ty.They're chewy.They go great with milk.And they're really hard to stop eating!They come in the new easy-open package.If you like soft, chocolate cookies, you will like these!They pretty much live up to they're name!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I did not know what to expect when I bit into one of these chocolate cookies. Very nice surprise! They are chewy and rich in the middle with a real chocolate flavor I've come to associate with hot cocoa. A Great addition to an excellent line of Chips  cookies. No, you can't eat just one."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Nothing spells fun more than 3 grandkids 14 years old and under opening a package with a new kind of cookie. Chips  did a great job on this recipe. Chocolate cookies with melty fudge chunks is just the best taste in the world. We all agree! You have 6 thumbs up on this one!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"For a 'gooey' cookie, I was expecting something, well, a bit more gooier and a stronger fudge taste.  These cookies had a decent chocolate taste and didn't lack for chocolate chips, but while they were soft they didn't really leave that much of a gooey impression (not to go overboard on the word, here, even if it's what's blazoned on the package).  If anything, they leave a bit of a dry mouth and call out for a glass of milk while munching on them, along with a bit of a sugary aftertaste (I had to double-check to see if there was any artificial sweeteners in the ingredients and didn't see any jump out from the list).So all in all, not a bad cookie if you're looking for something soft and chocolately to satisfy a chocolate craving, but a bit disappointing if you're hoping for something more along the lines of fudgey and moist."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I have always been a fan of the original Chips ! cookies and since I love chocolate, I had to try these. Unfortunately, I didn't care for them that much. The overall flavor is very chocolatey, however that's the best thing I can say about them. There is so little fudge in the center of the cookie, you barely can see it, let alone taste it. Since they're called ""Megafudge"", I expect a lot more fudgey-filling. The chips are quite small and don't add much to the cookie. My biggest complaint is that they're too soft. Many (very many) of the cookies in my package were partially or completely broken and crumbly because they're that soft. The cookies are also on the small side, yet they're 150 calories for only two. If they were bigger, didn't crumble so much and had a lot more fudge inside, I would have enjoyed these much more. But as they are, I won't get them again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Both my daughter and I are of course addicted to chocolate. This is a wonderful treat for our addiction. My daughter kept asking, ""More, Please!"" It is what you would expect from a chips  cookie, with the addition of fudge in the middle."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Basically I liked these cookies ok, but they're not my favorites. They were adequate. I don't think I'd turn one down if someone offered it to me, but I doubt that I'd choose them in the grocery store. You do get a lot of chocolate taste per cookie, although it was kind of cloyingly sweet overall.I was hoping the gooey fudge middle would add something special to the cookie-eating experience but it didn't really seem to do much for me. It was hard to even notice that it was there. The cookies are very small, with a crumbly, even, dry, texture. There are some white chocolate chips sprinkled throughout but I couldn't really taste them.The best feature of these cookies was that they are very chocolatey and killed my chocolate craving immediately after having just one - I put the package away. The worst thing was the dryness. Overall my impression is one of mediocrity. Not bad, not good. Not sure I'll be buying these in the future..."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"As an uber-chocoholic, I was excited to try these cookies. But they were very disappointing...while the fudge inside is good, the cookie itself is dry, not moist as I would expect. The chocolate flavor was kind of flat as well. I'm surprised these made it to the store shelves without more testing beforehand...they need to go back to the drawing board and try again!My husband liked them quite a bit until learning they have 75 calories per cookie! And they're SMALL cookies to boot. I am sure my kids will be happy to polish these off for me, but they just didn't do it for this chocolate fan."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Someone finally got the message. A few chips in a white cookie just doesn't cut it. Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are soft chocolate cookies. On the inside you will find white chocolate chips, semi-sweet chocolate chips and gooey fudge filling. The cookies fall apart too easily and I found several in the package already broken, but when they taste this good, who really cares? If you are entertaining, you may have a problem setting the cookies out, but who wants to share them anyway?Thanks Nabisco."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I have always been partial to soft chocolate cookies.  They're not only delicious, but we also get to be lazy while eating them for they just melt in your mouth.  These Chips  chewy gooey's, (CGs) are just about as soft and gooey and chocolaty as it can get in a mass produced, store brand cookie.  As far as their taste, I have to agree with the other reviewer here that compared them to the big Grandma brand chocolate cookies in both softness and flavor. (But not in the amount of chocolate chips, the CGS are a little more generous with them in that department).  If you happen to know or like those,  you will definitely love these smaller variations on the same theme.  They are just a shade above what one would call bite size, but still small enough to swallow whole by most true cookie lovers. As for their calories and nutrition, I'm afraid when I decide that I have a hankerin' for chocolate cookies, I reach for the sky.  I don't eat them everyday to be sure, so I make my moments in time with them everything they can be.  If you're at all health conscious when it comes to cookies, I suggest you pass these up and eat something healthier, that no doubt will meet the average cookie criteria of healthier, (more expensive with less flavor).  For the true cookie monster in your family, pick up some of these Gooey's on occasion, or order them in bulk here on Amazon. Trust me you will get rewarded with all kinds of big smiles for it..."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These Chips  Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are better than any I've made from scratch.  Upon opening the package in my receiving room, there was only one cookie left for me to bring to my apartment after the staff tasted them!  They are reminiscent of Pepperidge Farm soft chewy cookies but are more crumbly so they are best not eaten in a carpeted room.  I definitely will purchase them again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I've pretty much given up cookies because of the sugar and calories. However, I had heard good things about these and my son was very anxious to try them out.They are definitely chewy, gooey and fudgy. The taste is ok, but I thought there were a little too soft. The calorie count (210 calories for 3 small cookies) won't work for my diet.However, as an occasional treat for my teen age son, they are definite hit. He had seen all the hype on TV and was anxious to taste them. He loved the texture and the level of chocolatieness. (sp?) As he's a rather picky eater, even with sweets, this was high praise."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"At my house, I am known as the Cookie Monster. I love cookies and bake cookies, too. Chips ! (original) are one of my favorites.However, these are quite disappointing. The packaging size and pictures are very misleading. The cookies themselves are scarcely bigger than those ""toy"" cookies you get at McDonald's. See my customer images.As far as chewy and gooey, I would call them more like soggy. The ""fudge"" was a not-too-sweet and not-too-flavorful layer of filling in the middle which simply tears apart. See my customer image. They seem to be rather crumbly and mostly held together by their oiliness.  Compared to the Chocofudge variety, this Megafudge looks better but really doesn't taste any better.  In fact, I'd give a slight edge to the Chocofudge.Finally, a serving size is a laughable 2 cookies. These are so tiny, I easily ate four of them which is two servings at 150 calories an 7 grams of fat each serving. For a rather unsatisfying 300 calories and 22% of the USRDA of fat intake, I could definitely do better.I hope you found my review and customer images useful."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I grew up eating the normal Chips ! Chocolate Chip cookies. The eighties were a time where we didn't care whether or not something was locally source, or variety (sans Pepsi Clear) as we were more concerned about the various battles different robots (Transformers, Voltron, and sadly, the Gobots) were involved in across the universe.Enter Chewy Gooey Megafudge.Is it a fudge brownie? no.Is it a chocolate chip cookie? not exactly.To be honest, these cookies DID taste like brownies to me, but they had a strange crunchiness that I really kind of enjoyed (the crunchiness seemed to be scattered throughout its gooeyness). I read through the ingredients and noticed that these cookies are actually made with sugar (as opposed to high fructose corn syrup). There's always the chance that Palm Oil might scare you away (or it might attract you, depending on which side of the issue you stand).There is no denying that these cookies are very tasty. With or without milk. The texture is generally soft (apart from the crunchy bits I mentioned) and there is a substantial chocolate kick. The cookies are about the diameter of a medium sized Roma tomato (maybe 2 inches?) and the white chocolate is kind of hard to see. Additionally, my cookies were kind of square. This might be the result of heat, or shipping, or heat and shipping via the UPS delivery mode. If you have any questions, feel free to comment. If there was something you thought would have made this review better, comment as well - I'm pretty responsive (even to the negative stuff)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"For some reason I was expecting these cookies to be larger, more like the Grandma's brand size, but they were the same size as a standard crisp Chips ! cookie.The cookies were soft, and definitely gooey with the filling inside. I would say that, for my tastes, there was too much filling and too little cookie. I really like the texture of most soft cookies, but this one was a little too gooey for me. I would say the filling was more like chocolate frosting in consistency and less like fudge.The taste was very chocolatey, so if you're a big chocolate fan you might like these. There were small white chips sprinkled throughout, presumable white chocolate chips? but I couldn't taste them.I like the re-sealable package, I don't buy cookies much so I don't know if this is standard for Chips ! cookies now, but it's very convenient.Overall I would say that the taste of these cookies was good, but the texture was a little too chewy, with too much filling."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are so tasty! When I got them they were a little melted from shipping in the hot sun, so I put them in the fridge. When I pulled them out and ate them cold they were really great. I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that these cookies were enough to satisfy it. My only complaint is that I expected the fudge in the center of the cookies to be more liquidy because of the packaging which says 'chewy gooey' but they were still delicious and I would purchase them again. I received both this flavor and the Chocofudge. They were both great, but I prefer the chocofudge better."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Finding softness in a major brand supermarket cookie is usually a problem, so I was excited by the name of these cookies, hoping they would live up to their title and the picture on the package.While soft, they are not gooey or chewy. In fact, they are too soft, so one third of the cookies in my package were broken, some literally in crumbs. The fudge filling may contribute to their fragility.The fudge filling is not soft and gooey, but is more like the consistency of the filling in sandwich cookies. It adds an additional punch of chocolate flavor, but does not contribute to what little texture these cookies have.Throughout the cookies are apparently white chocolate chips, but they have no taste (even when sampled on their own). No white chocolate taste, not even sugar, just white bits of stuff that add some mild crunch.The flavor of the cookies is nice but is more like the ""fresh-baked"" cookies you might find in a grocery store than any home-made cookies. There is no discernible butter flavor and the chocolate flavor is mild in spite of the cookie's dark color.These cookies would be OK in a cookie jar, are too fragile for a packed lunch, and are small. All in all, they might be fine for occasional snacks, but don't look for a great experience."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"When I first bit into the cookie, I felt it was ""soggy"". While the cookies were supposed to be gooey, they come across as soggy and stale. For a cookie named ""Megafudge"" these cookies did not have a strong chocolate flavor. The cookies tasted more fruity than chocolaty. They almost reminded me of the center part of a fig newton.I am surprised that a product this awful could make it to market. They are perhaps the worst store bought cookies I have tried to date."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"...emphasis on the little. If you're watching your weight, don't pick these up to help you. 150 calories for 2 cookies is quite a bit. But, I thought the fudge center tasted pretty good, the white chips (white chocolate?) were not easily identified by sight nor taste. The problem I had was one of texture; the cookie itself is very dry, and the gooey center was like thick goop - not 'gooey' unless you decide to stick it in the microwave (or in the hot sun). A so-so product."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I have never been a fan of Chips  cookies, there is something about them that tastes artificial to me. But these Chewy Gooey cookies change that for me! They are just what they say they are, nice and soft and chewy with just the right amount of chocolate fudge inside. I love the white chocolate chips in them as well, they add a nice crunch to the otherwise soft cookie. These remind me of cookies you can find in a popular store located in most malls. I will be buying these cookies again!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are about 2 inches in diameter, which was smaller than I expected. They don't seem very chewy to me, more of a soft texture a bit chalky.There is a little bit of gooey in the middle, at first I thought the gooey was from melting in mail being delivered on the hottest day of the year so far but they actually withstand the temperature pretty well. I put them in the fridge as soon as I got them out of the mail since the packaging was hot but they didn't melt or change consistency.My boyfriend who loves anything cookie, actually didn't like these so much. He said they tasted like they weren't all the way cooked through, that might be the gooey middle giving him that impression.There are some white chips in the cookies, I am assuming they are white chocolate chips? They are kind of crunchy and I thought at first the cookie might have walnuts in it, but right now it is a mystery chip to me. The cookie is very sweet in my opinion. It lives up to it megafudge name with the sweetness and the gooey middle.I haven't made up my mind if I like this cookie or not. I kind of like the flavor but it is on the sweet side and I am iffy about the texture since it is not chewy as described in the title."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I was somewhat disappointed with these cookies. The packaging proclaims that they're ""Chewy Gooey"" and describes them as ""fudge filled soft cookies."" Well, they're definitely soft and they're certainly cookies, but calling them ""fudge filled"" is a bit of a stretch. There's a microscopic amount of ""fudge"" in the middle of each cookie, and their texture is noticeably dry. The taste is just all right--these cookies are nothing special, really, and at 150 calories (and 18% of the RDA of saturated fat) for each 2-cookie serving, there are a lot tastier snacks available on the market. You might be curious to try these for yourself, but I doubt these will become a regular presence in your cupboard."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I am actually torn about these cookies. There is a lot I like, and a few thigns I am not sure about. I mean, I don't require things to be especially natural when it comes to products like these, but I can't help but feel this gooey stuff in the middle is more than a little artificial tasting. This is beyond cremes in twinkies, cupcakes and stacked between oreos. The taste is not entirely pleasant, but I like the cookie. I also like the size of these cookies, small like the chips  and really chewy. I am going to freeze the cookies a bit and see if the goo warms up to me when it's colder. If you're into something that tastes more natural, definitely stay away. For those folks, try the Fig Newton Thins instead."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I'm not exactly a cookie connoisseur, but I love trying new types that are out on the market & I absolutely love soft cookies. I'd assumed from the ""chewy gooey"" part that the cookies would be soft, which was correct. I also assumed that anything with the word ""megafudge"" in it would also be pretty awesome. I was only partially right.Where the cookie goes right is that it's a very soft cookie. I don't think a hard cookie would really be all that great for something with fudge in the middle.Where the cookie goes wrong is that it's not particularly gooey as far as fudge goes. A thin layer of icing in a cookie does not automatically equate with gooey or fudge. The texture of this is also an issue. I shared some of these with a few of my coworkers & almost all of them mentioned that it was a strange texture, even the ones who adored the taste.Taste-wise this is ok. It's not a bad flavor, but it's not particularly great either. It's very rich & I wasn't really able to distinguish between any of the flavors (white chocolate, fudge, & chocolate). I hate to say it, but I've had better ""mega"" cookies.If you're looking for something ultra-decadent then you'll only partially find it here. I just don't think it's worth the guilt trip that I got later after eating them. The resealable packaging was nice but if you want some really rich & soft cookies, try the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TFSM92"">Oreo Cakesters</a>.I liked these fine enough but I don't think I'll be buying any on my own accord.2.5/5"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are good, but not great. They are almost overpowering. They are not so rich that they give you a stomach ache or anything like that, but the competing chocolates don't allow any of the components to stand out enough to be really enjoyable. I still prefer the regular Chips  Chewy cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I love chocolate cookies, but these are sorely lacking.Like many mass-produced soft cookies, these have an artificial, chemical taste to them. The package shows a gooey fudge center (as in the name, Chewy Gooey Megafudge) but the fudge-like center is quite solid, not soft and gooey. The texture of the cookie is fine, but the chocolate bits and fudge center are more granular than smooth and creamy.The packaging is great. I love the resealable packaging and found that it opened easily and sealed well.Although I would buy regular Chips  chocolate chip cookies, I would not buy these again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I like soft and hard cookies and would rather eat dessert than most other foods.  This cookie is soft and gooey, but the chocolate or fudge lacks quality and is mixed with all sorts of chemicals and artificial flavors.  It tastes like a store bought cookie that could not compete with a Pinwheel or Mrs. Fields packaged chocolate chip.  You can consume 70 calories wisely with Dove Miniature ice cream pieces made with ice cream and covered with wonderful dark chocolate.  One serving of Gooey Chips  is two cookies at 150 calories.The innovation appeared in the packaging.  There is a resealable lift on the top of the ""box"" which keeps the cookies fresher and it avoids breaking open the whole box to get one cookie.  Other than that, I was disappointed.  This is not your grandma's cookie recipe."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are soft chocolate cookies with a soft fudge-flavored filling.  Very tasty.  The fudge in these has a slightly dark chocolate flavor, which I like because I think it keeps the sweetness from being overpowering."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are grainy and quite bitter. I love dark chocolate but these cookies leave a bitter taste in your mouth after eating them. I personally would never eat these again. However, my kids loved them and ate the whole package in one afternoon, so I have to go with the 3 star rating."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Granted, I don't normally buy cookies, except at coffee houses, and those are cookies made locally by high-end bakeries that use organic and fresh ingredients.So, this Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge tempted me as something different, and honestly, I wanted to see what I might be missing.I was sadly disappointed. The Goo in these cookies are little bits of chocolate fudge and white chocolate.  The surrounding cookie does not have much substance and has a granular feel, not at all like I would expect from Chips !In case you are interested, here is the nutritional information:2 cookies (31g), about 9 servings per package:150 Calories, 60 from fat, 7g fat, 3.5 Saturated, 0 Cholesterol, 110 mg Sodium, 80 mg Ptassium, 21g Carbs, Less than 1g of Fiber (horrors!), 13g Sugars, 1g Protein, 8% Iron.At least they could have thrown in some vitamins and fiber.As it is I am going to toss these cookies and mark the yuck factor up to experience."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"It's over 100-degrees outside right now, and the poor mail lady has an open cab--no air conditioning.  So when she delivered these cookies from Amazon, I expected ""gooey"" to be taken to new levels, maybe gloopy or just completely melted.  But they were still perfectly intact.  And were not actually gooey at all.  You know how chocolate chips, once they are cooked and have cooled again, are not hard like uncooked chocolate, and are not gooey like freshly melted chocolate, but are actually slightly grainy like a brownie or something?  Well that is the texture of the chocolate in these cookies.What I do love about these cookies is the very chocolatiness.  The whole cookie is like a brownie.  Not fudge.  Fudge is milky and gooey.  These are brownie cookies; not milk chocolate, not gooey, but very very chocolatey.  I personally dislike milk chocolate.  I do love dark chocolate.  That could be why I like these cookies so well.They don't taste like fresh-baked cookies.  They are soft and moist, which is good, but they do taste packaged and preserved.  I guess that's not so shocking considering that they are actually packaged and preserved.  The cookies are small... I don't see a problem with that... as they are soft cookies; their size keeps them from crumbling under their own weight.This is a cookie for brownie lovers and dark chocolate lovers."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I thought they were alright, a nice fudgey flavor with caramel too, but my eight year old said they tasted like ""nothing"" to him and he didn't want anymore.  I hope to attach some pictures because when you think Chips  you think of a certain size cookie and these things are only slightly larger than an oreo.  The packaging is the same size as regular Chips  but there is alot of fill in the package.  The serving size is two cookies, and like I said they are small!  I got these for free through Vine but we won't be spending our money to buy more.  I am giving them only three stars based upon my son's reaction (after all I try not to eat cookies that often),the fact they are so small, and lastly because they break so easily just trying to remove them from the packaging.  I also let my sister taste them and she was not impressed...her exact words being ""not worth the calories,"" and this from a junk food junkie!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These Chips ! cookies were tasty. They were soft and chewy and had a strong chocolate taste. They were packed with chips that added even more chocolate taste to the cookies. The cookies are small - roughly 2 inches in diameter. While the serving size is two cookies, I could easily eat 5 or 6 with a nice glass of milk for an after-school or mid-afternoon snack."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I was excited to try the new Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies so of course when they came up for review I picked them immediately.  I LOVE Chips ! Cookies in the blue package and chocolate so of course I figured these would be AMAZING!There weren't a lot in the package and my first impression of them was that they smelled like brownies . . . they smelled good!  The cookies were full of chocolate, as the name implies, but they weren't really gooey.  I think of gooey cookies as the ones that are slightly undercooked when you pull them from the oven.  They are slightly warm - and of course these couldn't be since they came packaged - and they melt in your mouth!  These seemed to break apart easily as the texture seemed to be slightly dry.  I suppose I could have tried warming them in the microwave to see if that altered the cookie some, but I didn't think of that.  They were not hard and crumbly, but not really moist either.  In the center was a chocolate concoction that wasn't really gooey and of course chocolate and white chocolate chips throughout the outside of the cookie.  These combined with a chocolate cookie dough all added up to give this cookie quite a chocolate punch.  The cookies are definitely a chocoholic's dream cookie!  I did not feel that they left a bad taste in your mouth either like the other versions do.  But I found they were too rich and full of chocolate for me.  Sometimes you shouldn't mess with a good thing.  However, that being said if you are a chocoholic with a serious sweet tooth and you don't have time for homemade, warm from the oven cookies then these will do for you!  For me, I think I will stick with the tried and true homemade, and for emergencies the good old standby in the blue package - Chips !"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Not much more to say than the package says....They are indeed chewy and gooey and fudgey.  Chips  has always made a satisfactory mass produced chocolate chip cookie and the new fudge cookies are the same.  Not homemade but good."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I received these just today in the mail.  They had been sitting on my porch for an indeterminate amount of time.  I was pleased to see the easy open packaging that Nabisco has been using on their cookies.  When I opened it, all the cookies were intact and smelled very chocolately!  The cookies ended up being slightly warm from sitting outside, but I think that made them even better.  They tasted like fresh out of the oven cookies.  I broke one in half to examine the gooey inside.  It was, indeed, gooey and filled with chocolate.  If you aren't a big chocolate fan, you may want to try the original version, which I have also had.  Me, being a big chocoholic, thought that these cookies were great.  The white chips didnt have much flavor.  I think they were overwhelmed by the chocolate.  I would recommend maybe microwaving the cookie for a few seconds to get a nice warm center."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These seem to need to be handled with some care - when my package arrived, about half the cookies were broken and tumbled around inside the package despite the air packs around them.The cookies themselves are very dense and a little crumbly.  The inside isn't gooey at all, it's more of a thin layer of chocolate that reminded me a bit of the inside of an under-cooked brownie.  The taste is similar to one and doesn't have any crunch to it, just a thick chocolate texture.  One the plus side, you'll only need to eat one or two of these to satisfy your need for chocolate so the pack should last a while even though there are only about 20 cookies in it at 75 calories each."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"My cookies arrived with some broken, not sure what kind of packing would be best. They were packed with an inflated plastic packing pillow. Some other package might be better. Most of the cookies were not broken though. The taste is great and maked you want to have a nice cold glass of milk with them. You couldn't ask for more kind of chocolate in them. They are chewy if you eat them at room temperature.I wasn't disappointed in the size because 2 cookies give you 150 calories. They would be good to serve at a party along with some lower calorie snack. Not good to eat too many if you are trying to lose weight since they pack 13 grams of sugar!So, in summary, they are good once in a while."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I wanted to try these cookies because of the fudgey center.  I think these cookies are too soft, as the center kind of blends into the cookie, which is too soft. Some of the cookies were stuck together, or they break when you lift them out of the package.  The chocolate, both the cookie and the center tastes kind of fake to me.I think these cookies could be better if they weren't so soft, so the center would be more prevalent, and have a more real chocolate taste.  I also think they would be better if they were alittle larger, so that the cookie stands out from the center."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The one thing I can say about the new Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies, is that they are indeed Megafudge. It is a chocolate cookie with chocolate chips and white chocolate chips and then in the middle is fudge. No unlike the packaging the fudge in the middle was not very ""gooey"". It was a little chewy but nothing like the picture on the packaging would lead you to believe. Also I did not find the cookies to be as chewy as the normal Chewy Chips ! cookies. They are good cookies, a little too chocolaty for my taste, but I know that for you chocoholics out there, these new cookies will be right up your alley."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"If you are looking for a chocolatey treat then this is your cookie.  The label does not lie, this cookie is VERY gooey and has a great fudge taste.  I personally prefer chocolate cookies so this one was right up my alley.  The cookie wasn't too soft which is a bonus, some times a ""soft"" cookie can taste like it is not all the way done but this one was perfect."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Not bad for a bagged cookie. I generally dislike commercial packaged cookies but these are actually pretty good. Slight artificial flavor. Lots going on."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"This soft, gooey cousin to Chips 's crisp chocolate chip cookie, has much to offer for the chocolate lover. The almost-like homemade taste and softness gives the cookies a freshness not found in other similar cookies. In addition to white and dark chocolate pieces inside the cookie, is a delicious fudgey center. A chocolate cookie, with dark and white chocolate pieces, and a fudge center! Can it get any better?Whereas one cookie, most often isn't enough, these cookies are so rich that one cookie is plenty for an after-lunch, after-dinner, or anytime snack. The soft, chocolately, fudgey goodness goes great with a glass of cold milk or a bowl of vanilla ice cream.The package is also resealable, so that you don't have to finish all the cookies in one sitting. If you like chocolate and/or fudge, you'll be a big fan of Chips 's Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are amazing!  They are filled with delicious fudge, are coated in cookie and white chocolate chips. These are amazing for dipping in milk or tea. Chips ! These are dangerous."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I've tried both the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2"">Megafudge</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U43ZO0"">Chocofudge</a> versions of these cookies, and I'm writing a similar review for both.Overall, I enjoyed the taste of these cookies.  The center chocolate fudge (which is soft enough to bite through easily, but not actually gooey) is quite tasty and the highlight of the cookie to me.  Chips  did a good job on that part.  The cakey portion of the cookies taste pretty good to me, too, but the texture isn't great.  They are kind of dry and just crumble apart.  So, not hard and crunchy, nor moist and soft.  More like dry and soft.  If you're like me, you're definitely going to want something to drink afterwards.I've tried the cookies at room temperature, warmed up in the microwave, and chilled in the refrigerator.  I like them chilled the best because the cookies didn't crumble apart in my mouth like they did otherwise.  Warmed up in the microwave, it wasn't much softer than room temperature...just harder to eat with some parts being uncomfortably hot.  Perhaps warmed in the oven would be better, but I haven't been inspired enough to heat up Chips  cookies in the oven, yet.  :)These things are bite sized and have 75 calories and 3.5g of fat each.  Not horrible for a cookie, for sure, but the taste isn't good enough to get me to pick these over something else.Given that the chocolate ""fudge"" is the main attraction to me, I liked the Megafudge version with the chocolate exterior better than the Chocofudge version because the chocolate flavor was much stronger.  Both are around 3.5 stars to me, but with the edge to Megafudge, I gave them a 4 and the Chocofudge a 3 here on Amazon.I'd definitely suggest getting a single bag at the local store to try these out before buying in bulk.  You might love these, but four bags is a whole lot of cookies if you don't.  ;)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Chips  chewy cookies- yum!  Or so I thought.  I felt the cookies were meh.  Just ok.  Nothing to sing home about, not super fudgey, just mediocre.  They were just something I ate mindlessly and really could care less aboutI think the biggest pitfall for me to ding this product was the packaging, there's a pull top so you can open the cookies from the top (think of baby wipes, not the push lid but the refills where you pull off the top to open them and it's sticky) instead of having to open at the end and slide the cookie tray out.  Good idea, right?Idea and effort get an A.  The execution, not so much.  It would have been awesome had the package been resealable (mine was not, maybe faulty packaging? Who knows).  Other than that, good idea.  The cookies were just ok.  Not sure I would buy them in the store, that's just me though..."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I like to take cookies in my lunch, and I decided to give these a try since I love chocolate.  However I found these to be rather so so.  After looking at the ingredients I think I know why.  Three of them are in the over-processed or artificial category - enriched wheat flour, invert sugar, and artificial flavors.  The last is the worst to me because it screams that the taste of our product doesn't stand on its own.  While these cookies aren't ""spit it out"" bad, the taste is just off.  If you want a better tasting chocolate cookie give the Bear Naked Double Chocolate Soft Baked Granola Cookies a try instead.  I think you will be more pleased with the product, and the ingredients that make it up."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I am a huge lover of chocolate and just hearing the word ""megafudge"" makes me drool.  I was very excited to try out these cookies from Chips .  At first, even though I am a chocoholic, I was worried that these may be a bit overly chocolately.  However, after taking my first bite, I was in chocolate bliss.  The soft outer cookie and ooey gooey inner flow of chocolate was the perfect combination.  Normally I am not a fan of white chocolate, however these little white chocolate bits were not overly sweet and basically created a bit of a crunch, rather than that overly sweet flavor that is so common with white chocolate.  The different textures of gooey chocolate with soft outer shell and slight crunch all work together wonderfully.Yes, these cookies are sweet and rich.  One or two will be the perfect cure for any chocolate craving that you may have.  As a cookie and chocolate lover, these were perfect.  Between my two kids and I, the bag was gone in a couple of days.  These are also perfect with a cup of coffee as an afternoon treat/pick-me-up.I will definitely be purchasing these several times in the future and look forward to trying the Chips ! Chocofudge variety as well!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The Chips  Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are incredibly rich and chocolaty.  They remind me of Subway's double chocolate chip cookies, which are my favorites - except these go an extra step and have a gooey chocolate center. The centers aren't as creamy as the packaging or commercial would lead you to believe. But these are now one of my top picks for cookies. Delicious. Decadent. These will satisfy the most demanding of sweet tooth's."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I have always liked Chips  cookies but these are totally different than the normal ones. These are very moist and super rich. They really remind me more of brownie than a cookie but they are very delicious. They are very dark chocolate inside and out and they have a thin layer of fudge in the middle. The down side is the number of calories in each cookie. 75 calories per cookie is a little high in my opinion but since they are so rich you really don't need to eat more than two of them at a time."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I know some would say that ""homemade are better"" is a no-brainer, but I happen to think that some store bought cookies are just fabulous!  However, these are not in that category.  They were dry - far from being gooey - and quite tasteless.  They are also really small so it was not like you could lay them out on a plate and serve, they are more of a pop-in-the-mouth snack.  I personally would not get these again.This review is through the Vine Program."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are a soft, sweet cookie with a good flavor.  They are great for lunch packs and a quick snack.  They are pretty sweet, so 2 are a perfect snack for me.  I didn't really notice the marshmallows at first, but if you like chocolate, you will probably like these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I really like the taste of these, and the kids like them, too.  I was surprised to see how small the actual cookies are - they seem smaller than regular chips  - about the diameter of a 50-cent piece.The fudge in the center really isn't all that gooey - breaking a cookie open, it won't look like the picture.  Maybe if you heated it in the microwave it would.They are very soft, which I liked.About 18 cookies per package - they'll go quick b/c they're so small.I'd rather get them from the store - shipping them they get all jumbled up and crumby."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love fudge and have a terrible sweet tooth. So having said that these cookies are heavenly  and the whole family loves them,  grab a glass of milk and enjoy the ride!  Although because they are soft it makes them a little hard to dip because they kind of fall apart. However I still highly recommended as they are so so scrumptious!!!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"One of the best things about these strange little cookies is that they're irregularly shaped so your guests will believe you when you lie and say you made them. They're not common cookie cutter cookies. Somehow they almost seem friendly.Another notable thing is the slick resealable packaging. It had to be designed by a genius. When you pull the top of the package where it says ""lift,"" it slides back almost zipper-like to reveal the cookies and allows enough finger room to extract 4-5 of them at a time. (This is good if you're hungry, in hurry or sneaking cookies.) The top then glides back in place and seals the cookies completely so no air can get in. An engineering marvel!You may ask why the world needs another chocolate cookie. I don't know. I do know that people who eat chocolate cookies are known to be nice people. The world needs more of them. The world would be a friendlier place if more people had chocolate cookie crumbs clinging to their chins.The chocolate flavor in these cookies is more subtle than overpowering and isn't sickeningly sweet. Two or three cookies can satisfy a moderate chocolate craving, and four to six, a serious addiction. And you don't need teeth. These cookies are soft enough to gum your way to ecstasy.Try these cookies for the packaging alone. You can spend an enjoyable afternoon just unzipping and rezipping the top. Be honest. You could find a worse way to spend your time."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"It's not even about being a cookie snob. It's that these taste no different from my 30-year old memory of eating Chips  as a kid, so what has been done in the interim to make them better or more delicious? Nothing. They are waxy, falsely chocolate flavored and not worth the caloric bother, not even for the price."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"And that's because this cookie contains two types of chips:  white and chocolate.  It's nice and soft and practically melts in your mouth.  The size is nice, not too large and not too small, and the packaging is innovative:  You pull a strip and pull back the top covering - then it is resealable so the cookies stay fresh.I've put mine in the far pantry so as not to be tempted to overindulge.  It's working so far.These cookies are a Kraft Global product, so one expects a quality product.  To me, they do not disappoint!  In fact, I'd like to try other types of their cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are pretty delicious for a packaged cookie!I wouldn't exactly call it ""gooey.""  The fudge inside isn't going to melt out of the cookie and the cookie doesn't leave chocolate reside on your hands.  Its more like a 3/4 baked brownie.  Delicious, soft with some semi-solid center.I also like they the cookies are fairly small.  I'd like to think that this will lead me to eat less of them but it is probably more likely I'll just have two instead of one.I received this product free and, honestly, I don't buy many prepackaged cookies (I prefer to make my own) but, when I do need a quick fix, I'll probably choose these in the future."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are the company's newest creation. The cookie is a cross between a homemade version and store-bought with a flavorful gooey fudge center. Peppered throughout the cookies are morsels of chocolate chips. While the overall concept seems like a winner, the cookies leave a chalky taste in your mouth. I was hoping to be wowed by this delicious new treat; however, the product did not live up to my high expectations."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Chips  ! chewy Gooey Megafudge  is a chocolate lovers delight!! It is a tender, melt in your mouth cookie full of chocolatey goodness!! The fudge is great & is smack dab in the middle of the cookie ! The only down side is you may eat too many, they are that good! Try them, you will love them!!They are excellent !!!!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I had a group friends evaluate these cookies.  The chocoholics among them liked these cookies quite a bit and thought they were delicious.  Several thought that they were better than regular Chips .  I thought they had  lots of fudge and were chewy.  All in all about half of my friends liked them and half did not!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Just got these delectable cookies in today.  Half are gone already thanks to my son and daughter.This is not a subtle chocolate cookie.  They are the ""in your face and mouth chocolate that will know your socks off"" cookies.  It is like eating a cookie made from hot chocolate.  Smooth cocoa aftertaste.Goes very well with a glass of milk or in my case coffee.  They are soft cookies with nuts and a fudgy center--nothing like a brittle cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Q. What could be better than a super-chocolatey, fudgey, moist delicious cookie?A. Having it delivered to your house!Chips ! makes a great cookie with their megafudge line. They are chocolate cookies with white chocolate chips and gooey fudge mixed in.  The cookies are soft and moist and very rich.  One or two cookies will satisfy any chocolate craving.  Just smelling the chocolatey goodness makes my mouth water!The whole family liked these treats. Straight out of the bag, these cookies have a great melty fresh-made texture.  A couple seconds in the microwave and the Megafudge cookies are extra-melty and super delicious and feel like they came right out of the oven.Packed in the resealable fresh package, the Megafudge cookies are a great treat to have around the house.  And a couple seconds in the microwave may just fool your friends into thinking you're a gourmet chocolatier!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I have eaten Chips AHoy! cookies since I was a kid. There is nothing better than the Chips AHoy cookies and a glass of milk. Although their cookies are a little crunchy, with milk they're absolutely delicious.Their new cookies are even better. These are a soft chewy chocolate cookie with a gooey center that's also made of chocolate. You can get these either in fudge or dark chocolate.I tried the fudge, and I like these better than the original cookies now. In fact, if you're looking for a sweet snack that is satisfying, 2 of these cookies and an 8 oz glass of milk are perfect.These cookies are really sweet, and the chocolate center of the cookie is really melt in your mouth. That was the part I liked best: the chocolate middle. It just feels so good on your tongue, and it tastes even better, really smooth.If you're a chocolate lover who is looking for a sweet treat that will quickly satisfy you, this is it."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I had hoped that these cookies would be a nice, new take on the classic Chips . My family didn't like them and we threw out the package.The collective family opinion:- fake tasting - not like real chocolate- soft, but not moist- not gooey in the middle- did not smell good, smelled fakeNabisco used unbleached flour which is better than enriched bleached flour, and I applaud Nabisco for making that move. They also added a generous amount of white chocolate chips, but these didn't help the end product. We will likely try new Chips  products but won't be buying these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I never thought it possible but Chips  has produced an over-chocolate condition. On second thought, there isn't too much chocolate flavor, rather, the cookies are just too sweet to taste anything. Additionally the cookies are gooey to the point of falling apart. I don't know what they did to make them permanently out of the oven soft, but I detect a slight chemical taste."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"My son says give this a ""10 out of 10"".  I first tried these a few days ago and although they are crumbly and fall apart easily, they are soft and delicious enough to make it worth it.  My son had his first today and since he is more of a cookie connoisseur than I am, I am going with his rating.  He likes that they are ""soft, but not gooey"".  So although I just realized that the description Chips  gave them is Chewy Gooey, I guess its not the ""gooey in a bad way"".The packaging is good and includes a resealable flap to allow us to enjoy some immediately and some later."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Honestly, I thought this would be an easy four or five star rating. How can you go wrong with chocolate chip cookies? Obviously, there are a couple of ways. One major complaint is in the packaging. I opened the container up and was met with a crumbly mess. This is partly due to the texture of the cookies. Most were broken, but there were about five still intact. One bite and the cookie crumbled into pieces.Another problem was the cookie was dry and there wasn't a chewy gooey feel to the chocofudge. If you can block out the dryness, there's a powerful chocolate flavor that is sweet. It could totally satisfy a chocolate craving.The bottom line is unless major improvements are done, I wouldn't purchase these even on sale. I also wouldn't recommend them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookie attempts to the be molten chocolate cake of the cookie world.  It is a chocolate cookie with white and dark chocolate chips.  Inside, according to the picture should be near liquid chocolate.  Unfortunately, although I did have soft chocolate in the middle, it was not nearly as soft as the picture hints at.  Nevertheless, it is a tasty snack.  The different textures of cookie, chips, center, blend well together to give a different type of cookie eating experience."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are a lot richer than I anticipated!  I was expecting half-hearted ""megafudge"" and while it doesn't run out of the cookies, the cookies themselves are so rich that the fudge that *is* in the middle is still more than adequate.  Sit down with 2 cookies and big ol' glass of milk and enjoy!  Just make sure you have a napkin handy because they are super soft and will crumble if you're heavy-handed or if they're warmed (YUM!).  My husband said he could eat the whole package in a single sitting with a gallon of milk!  They're THAT good!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I am a big fan of chocolate and chocolate chip cookies, so I am somewhat partial to these gooey cookies. They are filled with chocolate fudge, which makes them noticeably sweeter than most other chocolate chip cookies. They are certainly very gooey, but they are not at all chewy. They are also much smaller than most other Chips ! chocolate chip cookies. They are very crumbly, and I am even tempted to leave them in the fridge to stiffen up. Like most other Chips ! packagings, the box has an easy resalable cover which will help keep the cookies fresh for as long as they last. Overall, these are good chocolate-chips cookies that add a new twist to this kind of sweets."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The MegaFudge Chips ! cookies do nothing to add to their non-fudge-filled counterparts. These cookies look, smell, and taste just like the original Chewy Chocolate Chips ! cookies. Not too sweet, not too salty, not leaving a heavy chemical aftertaste.The fudge center of the cookies is not as the picture on the package would lead you to believe. The fudge is not gooey. It is much thicker and drier than the picture shows. It also has a grainy, almost crunchy texture that while not offensive, does leave me a little confused.Megafudge Chips ! are decent cookies, but there is nothing special here that would entice me to buy these instead of store-bought chewy chocolate chip cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Nabisco describes these as ""fudge filled soft cookies"" [sic], and that's basically what you get.  And yes, they are kosher.The PackageYou get about 18 cookies in the package, inside the standard flat tray of 3 rows (the plastic is recyclable!).  The package opens with a security strip-equipped and resealable flap on the top.  All cookies inside were moist and chewy when the package was opened.I don't know if this was a result of these cookies being mailed, but when I opened the package, two of the rows of cookies had stuck completely together, so I got two reeeeeally thick cookies.  It looks like if the cookies are stored with the tray horizontally, then they're fine, but if the package is turned on either side, their respective moistness, which is a big part of the product's allure, makes them glom together.  Prying them apart led to some cookie disintegration.The packaging tells me these cookies are ""chewy gooey.""  I fully concur on the chewy part.  Not nearly as chewy as, say, an <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006136E0"">Archway cookie</a>, but sufficiently soft and chewy.  But ""gooey?""  Sorry, but not really.  ""Gooey"" means delicious adhesive inside filling-stuff forming delicate little strings of fun and edible stringiness when I take a bite, like cheese from a hot pizza, or the caramel inside a Milky Way.  Sorry, but none of these cookies delivered anything like that.  The packaging has a picture of a cookie being split apart, with a web-like glob of gooey fudgy goodness being revealed (see image).  I attempted with six cookies to recreate this event, and did not succeed.  The cookie is too soft to be pulled apart in this fashion, and the fudge glob contained inside each cookie is insufficiently gooey to be pulled apart as depicted.The packaging also proclaims ""megafudge.""  Sorry, again, but I just didn't get the sense of megafudge.  ""Fudge sufficient to be factory-injected into a cookie"" is much more accurate. ""Megafudge"" is a villain in a cartoon movie, I think.From the date on the package, it appears you get a shelf life of roughly 3-4 months with an unopened package.The Product:While the cookies aren't officially bite-size, at about 2"" across they pop in easily.You get about 18 cookies in the package.  That's about 9 servings, at 150 calories apiece, for a total of about 1350 calories in the package (about the same as a Baja Fresh steak quesadilla).  You essentially get no Vitamins A or C, or calcium; you do get 3.5g of saturated fat, though.Most of the cookies in my package were a bit beat-up and somewhat crumbly, likely from being mailed.  But that center of fudge kept them largely together; these cookies will not just break in half.The fudge is on the inside, but there are still some chocolate chips in the cookie dough itself, so this is something that will leave chocolate on your fingers and anything else it comes in contact with.  Giving a handful of these to a toddler in an all-white living room would be a bad idea.And how did the cookies taste?  Well, there was no overwhelming rush of fudge-tastical transcendence.  But neither was there any disappointment.  They taste just fine, as I would expect from a factory that makes tens of thousands of these a day.  The texture in the mouth is good, with just a little bit of pseudo-crunch from small white chocolate chips.  The taste is heavy on cocoa.Bottom line: It's a soft cookie with some squishy stuff in the middle, and it tastes just fine.  Not the best cookie I've ever had, not even close, but also a really long way from the worst cookie I've ever had.  If you like your chocolate and fudge and cocoa, this one will work for you.  If you like your chocolate taste more subtle, this isn't the best choice."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I don't eat cookies very much, but when I do, I tend to luck out and get good ones. I also managed to finally luck out with the Vine program, and got a sweet snack just before they were out of stock. The only other Chips ! cookies I've tried are the standard chocolate chip ones, and I thought they were ok. But good lord is this a huge step up from those. They aren't messing around with the name 'Gooey Megafudge'. These things are loaded with enough sugar to wipe out an entire village of diabetics. But hey, it's a tasty way to go.While I do agree that there's a kind of chalky taste to hem, I love the marshmallows they used for these. It reminded me of eating Rocky Road ice cream when it's really hot out, and the marshmallows are getting soft from the heat. The cookies are on the small side, but still have more than a fair share of calories. And depending on how big of a chocolate fan you are, one cookie just might be enough for a quick snack. For other parents out there, I'd watch it when leaving a pack of these within your child's reach, because two or three could have them bouncing around all over the place. As a whole, the cookies are better than I was expecting, and while it's obvious they're not healthy at all, there are better options out there for your cookie fix...though maybe not anywhere near as chocolatey.I doubt I'll buy a pack in the future, but everyone I've shared with seems to like them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I was expecting the worst when I chose to review these soft, gooey cookies, because I've never liked the texture of packaged soft cookies.  They've always tasted more like weirdly elastic edible plastic than honest food.  But it's been a few years since I've tried a soft cookie, and hey, chocolate and fudge -- it was time to see if they'd improved.I had second thoughts, looking at the package, wondering if some huge puddle of liquid fudge would squirt into my mouth, but once I opened them and saw their normal-cookie looks and, more importantly, got a whiff of mouth-watering chocolate, I promptly bit one in half.  No weird plastic bendiness to deal with, just some slightly crunchy little white chocolate chips and a quarter-sized bit of fudge filling in what my husband calls, rightly, a ""cakey-brownie-like cookie.""These little guys are perfect with milk or crumbled on ice cream, but my mate says they're best when you just let them melt on your tongue. That's when the fudge filling is most noticeable -- and in a very good way.We ate up the package of cookies much too fast and picked up another at the market.  That's how much we like them: we rarely buy cookies but we had to have more."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I have a weakness for anything chocolate and these cookies did not disappoint. They are very soft, chewy and the chocolate flavor is fantastic (reminds me of Dutch processed cocoa). They are wonderful with milk. One cookie has 3.5g fat. It is very hard to only eat one of these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are soft and chewy just like you'd expect from Chips , but they also contain gooey fudge inside.  They are definitely yummy and not too chocolatey, but I will say I expected more ""gooey"" from them and really inside the fudge is thicker and not really gooey at all.  Overall though they definitely satisfied my chocolate craving and I love that they were so soft."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I've always like the Chips  chocolate chip cookies (I remember when they were much larger!).  That's why I thought I would try these but they are overly sweet with an artificial chocolate flavor.  Not worth the calories, salt and chemicals.  There are much better choices in cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The name of the cookies doesn't seem to match the cookies.  They are neither chewy nor gooey. They are rather ordinary cookies that have an odd artificial taste to them.  They are also on the small side, so at 150 calories for two cookies they would not be a wise choice for someone watching his weight.  The resealable package is a good idea."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies were not bad, but they weren't really good either.  I was happy to find that they are very soft.  I prefer soft cookies.  The chocolate taste does come through.  However, the cookies are also a little gritty or sandy; the texture is very odd.  Also there is something in them that tastes a little off.  I've definitely had much better cookies like Soft Batch and Mrs. Fields.  For the price, they're not bad, but there are much better cookies out there."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"As a chocolate lover and sometime baker and pastry chef, I set out to find out exactly what these cookies are. The answers are not what you'd expect.First of all, they're very sweet, as in Hostess Cupcake sweet, and there is absolutely nothing subtle about them. Second, they're made with both dark chocolate and white chocolate chips, but not enough white chocolate to take the edge off the enormous amount of chocolate and sugar they contain.Now, as regards the name ""fudge,"" this they ain't. If you're thinking of fudge as a candy, you won't find it here. Nabisco would have been better off calling them ""chocolate cream cookies."" While they have a regular cookie texture on the outside, what's inside is more like a ganache, which is what you get if you bring a pot of cream almost to the boiling point and then pour in a bunch of chilled, shaved chocolate, so that the chocolate melts slowly into the cream. The result is not as thick as frosting, nor as firm as, say, the filling in an Oreo. It is, literally, a chocolate cream. Using a ganache is a nice touch, but it's not fudge.I suspect the ""chewy, gooey"" texture is a new venture for the Chips  brand. Getting a cookie to be truly soft involves using more liquid in the batter, which is the contribution of the chocolate cream or ganache, and removing the batch from the oven when it's still slightly undercooked.All in all, I certainly wouldn't turn them down, but would probably prefer something with more flavor and texture, such as those delicious tubular European cookies filled with a chocolate-hazelnut cream. Too bad the hazelnuts give me migraines. On the other hand, I've been known to pour chocolate syrup on marble fudge (also not fudge) ice cream, so you may want to try these out for yourself.Bottom line, interesting, but certainly not a regular purchase."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I normally like chips  (and just about all things chocolate) and these sounded like they'd be good!  I was wrong.  I don't know what the ""gooey"" stuff is in the middle, but it tastes incredibly artificial.  Plus, at 75 calories per cookie, they're hardly worth it.Considering all the chocolate they pile into these, they don't have that great of a chocolate flavor.  The concept is good, but the execution is a far cry from decent.  Also, the white chocolate chips in them - really?  What's the point of that?  If you're wanting megafudge cookies, are you really looking for white chocolate?  (Which actually has no cocoa in it...)  And I don't know if they had to alter the dough recipe in order to keep the fudge inside, but that part isn't good either.  It also has a kind of fake, I-left-these-in-my-hot-car-for-six-weeks kind of taste to it.  Blech!Personally, I'd rather have a regular chocolate chip cookie than these things.  If I'm gonna eat a cookie, I want it to taste like a real cookie, not like a bad recipe gone horribly wrong.  After eating two of these, I don't plan on eating anymore, ever."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies aren't bad, but it's strange that ""Chips !"" has very few chips, and ""gooey"" is really just frosting.The consistency is kind of like an undercooked brownie, with a few white chips that just taste like sugar. And as noted above, the ""gooey"" center is frosting, which is actually less gooey than the chocolate filling in a fudge Pop Tart before it's been toasted.The flavor is pretty much ""sugar"" with a touch of chocolate. Regular Chips ! have a more complex flavor than these. So, if you see some kind of in-store ""buy one get one"" sale, you might want to give these a shot. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"How is it possible for Chips  to make a horrible cookie???  I have no idea, but they did.First, the cookies are WAY smaller than the picture on the bag.  But if the cookies are good, who cares.The problem is, they're not good.  Not good at all.  They're very artificial tasting, and not very chocolatey at all.I wanted these cookies because the ""Gooey"" label made them look irresistible.  I was so disappointed though!!!  The gooey stuff doesn't taste terribly gooey, it tastes - and this is weird for a liquidy substance - dry.These are not worth the calories.  There are much better cookies out there."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I saw the name ""Chips !"" and thought of delicious, crispy chocolate chippy goodness. Alas, these don't live up to the brand name.I rarely buy storebought cookies, honestly, so I really looked forward to trying these as a treat. Here's my two cents:1. The allegedly mega fudge filling is not very noticeable except as a faintly chemical, chocolate-like slime. Minifudge filling would have been more accurate. The last two days were quite warm and the cookies became almost liquid on contact with warm fingers. Quite a mess, especially with kids. In short, the gooey filling seems to me a gimmick.2. The cookie part tasted like fake chocolate, which was a turnoff for me. I love chocolate like nobody's business, but it has to be GOOD chocolate (which this was definitely NOT.) A chocolate candy bar of almost any kind would have been more satisfying.If I want a tender cookie, I can make better ones myself from scratch. If I'm going to buy a chocolate chip cookie, I'll stick with the original crispy Chips ."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The name Chips ! to most people means a basic, commercial chocolate chip cookie that's been around since 1963. And they've been around since then because they are a classic cookie with a great taste, the best selling commercially made chocolate chip cookie in the United States. I'm one of the many fans of the cookie, so I was interested in trying this new variety of Chips .This new variety is indeed very chocolatey. The texture is soft, and even softer inside, the gooey fudge. There is a white ingredient in the cookie, I assume it is a white chocolate chip, that is a different texture than the rest of the cookie. The white chocolate chip really didn't offer much in the way of flavor, and the texture of it was rather off-putting.That's not to say this cookie isn't good. It is very good. If you like soft-baked,ultra-chocolatey cookies (and wouldn't mind the texture difference of the harder white chocolate chips) you'll like this cookie. As for me, I'll stick to the classic Chips ! I've known and enjoyed for so many years."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"My favorite cookie is a chocolate chocolate chip cookie from Otis Spunkmeyer.  So when these cookies came up for review I was EXCITED!!!  When I got them I opened them right away and took a bite.  I nearly spit it out in a napkin.  It was that bad.  The cookie itself was dry.  The chocolate flavor was off.  The chips in the cookie were crumbley and the middle of the cookie wasn't gooey at all.  It looked and tasted more like frosting that was a couple of days old.  The packaging states these cookies are crammed with real chocolate chips and creamy fudge.  To get the cookie I got after reading a description like that is nothing but a disappointment.  These will not a something that makes it on my shopping list.... ever."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Hopefully you're not imagining that these cookies might be as good as home made.  Of course they're not.  They're  mass-produced, very sweet cookies that are fall-apart-in-your-hand soft and only slightly chewy, with a creamy--not fudgey--center. It's not as though you can't find really tasty, quality cookies in a package at the supermarket, but these are not first-class cookies even on the scale of what the big companies crank out by the millions. For example, Pepperidge Farm's soft-baked Captiva and Chocolate Chunk cookies are very similar in concept, but superior.The word ""fudge""--let alone ""Megafudge""--may conjure up Willie Wonka-like fantasies, or have you thinking you'll be biting into a big block of deep, dark chocolate fudge.  No, no, no. They're chocolate alright, but they look and sound a lot more chocolatey than they taste--not the kind you get from a bar of dark chocolate or premium chocolate ice cream, let alone fudge, but a disappointing, how-can-something-so-dark-brown-have-so-little-chocolate-flavor kind of taste. I can picture these being formulated in a lab by men in white coats, using jars of brown and white powders and syrups in test tubes. That kind of ""chocolate."" Those reviewers who squeal that these have a rich chocolate flavor sadly don't know what they're missing.  They're also smaller than I expected; maybe two inches in diameter, not the sort of three- or four-inch disks you'd likely find in a bakery (or the Pepperidge Farm varieties), or would make at home; you'll need two or three just to feel like you've eaten something.If you put some in your child's lunch, will he or she like them?  Why not--he or she will likely be enjoying the sugar rush for an hour before falling asleep.  If you sit down in front of the TV with them can you eat ten of them before you know it?  Sure. But really, they're nothing special."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies had an unusual texture- they were somehow dry on the outside and slightly tough in the middle (like undercooked pasta almost).  The chocolate chips were soft and melty, but the flavor wasn't exactly right- This is hard to explain, but it didn't taste like chocolate is supposed to- artificial maybe.  My husband didn't like them much either.  They weren't terrible, but you certainly couldn't pass them off as home-made- nor would you want to.  I didn't even realize that there was a chocolate center in the middle till I read the package- after I'd eaten 3 already.  Since I didn't notice, it didn't seem to contribute much to the flavor.  I'd eat them if I was hungry and they were the only thing in the pantry, but they won't be on my grocery list."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Great tasting chocolate cookies with a nice fudge center. These cookies are great for a chocolate lover and anyone who loves a super moist cookie because they are soft and moist. I love the consistency and the taste of these cookies. I will buy the cookies again.These cookies are similar to what a gourmet bakery will offer with out the overpricing of the bakery. I wish they were a little firmer so that when I microwave them they don't fall apart. The reseal able packaging is perfect to keep your cookies nice and fresh without worrying about them getting stale or attracting any insects. Great Job Chips  with this new Megafudge line of cookies my son and I loved them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are pretty good.  They are very chocolaty and extremely moist.  The fudge in the middle of the cookie is tasty, although there was less than I thought there would be.  I marked these down one star because there is a slight artificial taste to the cookies.  Its not a huge detraction but noticeable.  However, after eating one, I immediately craved another, and to me, that is the sign of a tasty cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"You can't really compare these to fresh, bakery cookies, but for off-the-shelf store cookies, they're pretty good. Sweet, and just a bit doughy, as you might expect, but not as over-the-top as you might fear. They somehow survived delivery on a 103 degree day without falling to pieces, but who would complain about warm fudge cookies?When it comes to store-bought cookies, I prefer crunchy, so I would not make these my regular go-to cookie, but I would recommend them for those times when you feel like a softer, fudgier, brownie-like treat. They taste a lot like another popular brand of cookie that is often found in vending machines.Pass the milk!FOLLOW UP: I wrote this review before my wife and college-age daughter got home and discovered these cookies. I don't think a pack of store cookies ever disappeared so fast. Again, probably won't be a regular purchase, but as an occasional indulgence, these are a hit!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"This was an okay cookie.  It's more of a cross between a dry brownie and a soft cookie.  It was chewy, but I wouldn't say it was all that gooey as the name implies.  The double dose of chocolate and nuts are great for chocolate lovers, though.  And I did like the re-sealable package, so the cookies will stay soft longer.  If you like double chocolate cookies with nuts and/or Chips  cookies, you may like this one.  I liked them, but I did not love them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I have quite a sweet-tooth and often have a very difficult time avoiding sweets, especially when they're free.  So when these Chips  Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies showed up on Vine I had to give them a taste.  Needless to say I was not disappointed.  If you like rich chocolate packaged cookies then these bite sized snacks are for you.  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Made with real chocolate.+ Bite sized cookie portions.+ Easy to open resealable package.Cons- Still have a bit of that artificial preservative packaged cookie taste.- 150 calories and 13 grams of sugar per serving (2 cookies = 1 serving).- White chocolate chips can be a little crunchy.- Not really very gooey.Generally I'm not a fan of packaged cookies but these were actually pretty good.  Sure you could still taste the artificial side of these treats but that's sort of expected.  If you're a chocolate lover and don't mind prepackaged cookies then these are worth a try.  If you prefer a more homemade tasting cookie then you'll probably want to give these pass."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"As of this writing, June 26, 2011, this product, Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies, has been reviewed 165 times, the first being six days ago.  If you want to know more about the taste and texture of the cookies, stop reading this review now and read the other ones, because I have almost nothing to say that hasn't been said about the cookies themselves, except that I can go long periods of time without these cookies or any others.  Oh, and also, that where the package says, ""Fudge Filled Soft Cookies,"" which is missing a hyphen, and elsewhere where it says, ""FUDGE-FULLS,"" or perhaps ""FUDGE FULLS,"" the cookie IS somewhat harder and gooier (or is it ""gooeyer""?) in the core than elsewhere.  I my own personal self prefer the non-core parts.No, all I want to review is the packaging, because if you read every single review to date and the ones that are sure to follow you will find all you need to know about the contents thereof, whereas the subject of the package is rarely addressed, at least not as thoroughly as you no doubt want if you really have read all the other reviews about the cookies themselves.There's both good and bad in the packaging.  The wrapper appears to be Mylar or some other silver-colored plastic with a second layer of plastic that holds the labelling image, and inside is a molded plastic tray with exactly five cookies in each of exactly three bins for a total of an average of exactly a dozen or or a dozen and a half cookies.  Please don't quote me on this, because last time I did math I goofed it up and got in trouble, but I think the answer, at least according to Sesame Street, is 15 cookies.The way you open the wrapper to expose the goodies inside is to pull rightward on a tab at the left side of the top.  It's kinda' difficult to get at the cookies in the leftmost bin compared to the other two, but if this problem so thoroughly stumps you that you find yourself hauling out a chain saw or 911ing the fire department, you probably won't be able to figure out how to open that flap anyway.The neato aspect of that top flap is that when you close it, sticky strips on the perimeter of the bottom surface of the flap adhere nicely to matching strips of Mylar on the wrapper proper.  I can't prove it, but I'm guessing this will reduce evaporation of water from the cookies, which will keep them both moister or more less drier, or both, compared to the more normal ways of closing such a package.  Of course, designing and testing this improvement and paying for the new machinery to apply the stickum, not to mention the cost of the stickum itself, all cost money, and that cost has surely been passed down the chain of commerce to us consumers.  You get to decide whether it's worth it to you.  If you snarf down these cookies like a chocaholic trencherman, it won't be.  If you wish not to add to your body's load of excess sugars and fats and carbohydrates but can't resist buying this product to begin with -- and if you have the self-disclipline to eat only one or two a day -- this feature of keeping them fresher than if they were in a plain wrapper that can't close as hermetically might be worth it.The top of the package shows an enlarged photograph of part of one representative cookie, and elsewhere it shows three distinct bits that have been added to and show up distinctly in the dough.  Stupid me, I assumed the lighter-colored ones were nuts of some kind, but they are not.  I'm not saying it says anywhere on the packaging or on the Amazon product page that there are nuts in these cookies, I'm just telling you the assumption I made.  And I'm telling you it's wrong.  I'm not sure what the light-colored bits are a picture of, and maybe I don't care, but I admit I'm curious.  The same goes with these other bits depicted in the photograph.  They're more dark than the first bits I mentioned, but they have a kind of swirl in them.  I don't know what they are either, and maybe all the other reviewers have figured it out, but I haven't, and I am curious yet again.  The third type of bit in the cookie dough is what I am almost 90% sure is a chocolate chip.COOKIE VolumeThe several cookies I measured average so close to 1-15/16 of an inch across that I'm going to pretend that's the average, even though I've measured with calipers only seven of them.  The height measured at half the radius along, which seems a reasonably representative spot to choose, varies from approximately 0.243 inches to approximately 0.425 inches, with an average I will round a tiny bit down (less than the length of a human hair) to 3/8ths of an inch.  Geometry tell us that a cylinder with diameter 1.9375 inch and height 3/8th inch has a volume of pi times the radius squared times the height, which in this case is pi times (0.96875 squared) times 0.375.  According to my pencil (yes, I know calculators exist, but I still don't trust 'em), the volume of one cookie is just a touch smaller than 1.105616653 cubic inches.The volume of 15 cookies is simply the aforecalculated 1.105616653 cubic inches times 15, which is 0.071793289 gallons.  Yes, I've used up a lot of pencil lead doing these calculations, but I want to get it right this time, and the last five hours have NOT been wasted.TRAY VolumeThe width of the tray inside is 221 millimeters, the length 95 millimeters, and the depth 56.5 millimeters.  The volume, of course, is simply those three numbers multiplied, which, as if you didn't know, is 0.03979426 firkins.The rest of the math is simple.  You convert gallons to firkins and then compare total cookie volume to tray volume.  The result, which I dare you to challenge, is the number 3.3648301288323, which means that the tray volume is a little more than three times larger than the cookie volume.CONCLUSIONI am not an expert on the subject, but I think I am still allowed to wonder whether the outside dimensions of the package are meant to convey that there's a lot more cookie inside than it appears.  It seems obvious that if you can do that, you will sell more hogsheads of cookies per fortnight.If that is the intent of the people who decided on the exact packaging that I'm reviewing, and if it is not otherwise justifiable, then they are lying to us.  They are not lying by comission, because the package clearly states that the cookie contents weigh 10 ounces (283 grams), and I have verified that the contents of my exact package weigh not merely 10 ounces but rather 10.25 ounces, which is 2.5% heavier.No, they are lying only by omission, in that they do not state clearly or at all on the package that it is more than 3 times bigger than the cookies therein.I am thinking, by way of comparison, of plain old saltine crackers in four sleeves in a box.  When you look at that box you have a pretty good idea of how much volume in crackers you're gonna' get.  Even if the volume of that box is a full one third larger than the volume of the stacks of crackers therein, that's still 9 times more accurate than the Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies' box.I rate this product with the ""It's OK"" rating, three stars, because it seems just that."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The Chips  ""Gooey"" is a ""brownie-like tasting cookie."" I especially  liked the taste of the white chocolate contrasted to the surrounding rich dark chocolate. It invites dunking one in a cold glass of milk to make the chocolate experience linger even longer.I like the nutrition qualities, especially the 80 mg of Potassium.  A  serving (2 cookies) has only 21 grams of carbohydrate and 110 mg of sodium.  The 13 grams of sugar and 150 calories are a bit much for me but is acceptable if I eat only one serving.I did not like the package.  It was hard to open and then could not be resealed.  So in the dry climate where I live the cookies dry out unless you store them in another container.  However, in my house, the package did not last long.  My son and grandson emptied the package within a couple of days.I recommend Chips  Chewy Gooey Megafudge for people who can eat just one serving.  Grandchildren may need to be given limited servings, but they will love these cookies.."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Not really impressed by these cookies. They are too sweet for me, and don't have much fudge flavor. Also, they are more soft and gooey than chewy. Maybe they're OK as a kid's desert, but I think adults will want something with more flavor."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"This is an interesting cookie that seems to have more the consistency of cake than cookie. While it is soft, it's not chewy, it's also a little short on the gooey part; the fudge filling was there but I had to look for it. The chocolate chips use semi-sweet chocolate and the overall impression is of a soft, very chocolate cookie that's not all that sweet.For those who prefer somewhat less sweetness this cookie may provide a perfect answer. The cookies are good and it's all too easy to surpass the published serving size of two cookies. The two cookie serving has 150 calories of which 60 come from fat. I noticed that the major oil was palm oil followed farther down the ingredients list by coconut oil and lastly soybean oil. The sodium content for two cookies was 110 mg. There appear to be around 18 cookies in the bag, 9 servings.I'm of the opinion that these cookies are better suited for an adult's taste buds; I think they might go well with tea or coffee and they do offer something of an unexpected taste experience."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookie combines a rich, gooey chocolate fudge cookie with rich chocolate chips. It was great back in the day, even though I've since become more abstemious in my ways."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Okay, I just saw a review that said these cookies costed them 4 bucks.  I just bought a pack for a dollar fifty ($1.50).  So that stated.THESE COOKIES WERE FABULOUSLY DEEEEELICIOUS.  SMH.  OH SO SAD HOW DELICIOUS THESE THINGS ARE.  IF YOU LOVE CHOCOLATE THESE ARE FOR YOU!!!Now mind you when I saw and thought to buy these I thought of my last endeavor with nabisco and a new product.  Those horribly nasty chocolate covered oreos.  they were a waste of my money and I was pissed that I still had a whole pack left.  smh.But these cookies right here...  smh.  ridiculously delicious.  smh.  Mines were gooey, chewy, and oozing chocolate on my fingers as I ate them.  I just now looked to get another cookie out of this too small 10 ounce package and was pissed that I just ate the last one.  smh.But then maybe it's best that the pack is only 10 ounces.  cause being this good if there were more I'd inhale the whole package of that size just as quickly.Don't get discouraged by the white chips on the package.  The taste of chocolate in these cookies is so delicious and so intense that the white chips, (whatever they are) become nonexistent.I say this.  cause I don't like white chocolate, and it's one of the main reasons I was skeptical about buying these cookies.  buy them, try them for yourself.  Totally delicious.  If Nabisco continues to knock it out the park like this, maybe they'll make a comeback in my household.  cause I had stopped buying cookies from disappointment in what I've received in the recent past."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I think Nabisco has a different definition of ""gooey"" than I do. These aren't what I'd call gooey. They're moist(ish) and they have some semi-solid filling with the consistency of marzipan, but they're not gooey.They are delicious, though. Quite so. Chocolate is one of my favorite things in the universe, and while these aren't gourmet chocolate, they are decent American chocolate. If you enjoy devil's food, you'll like these.My only complaint is that these cookies seem to have fewer in the package than the non-gooey variety. Whether or not the filling is worth giving up a few cookies is up to you."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These are honestly the strangest cookies, but really delicious.  I don't know how they figured it out but the ""gooey"" feature of these cookies make them feel like they just came out of the oven even though they are room temperature.  They are certainly very chocolately and will meet your craving for something sinful anytime you open the box."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Sigh, the problem with getting tasty-looking samples from the Amazon Vine program is that once the delivery package is opened and the product put on the shelf, it's fair game for younger family members who are always hungry and looking for a treat.  And that's what happened here. In this case, our son grabbed it up.  Here's how the conversation went:Me:  Where are those ""Chips !"" cookies I put on the shelf?Son:  They were good!Me:  Yeah, but where's the package?  You ate ALL of them?Son:  Oops.  Sorry.Me:  I was supposed to review them for Amazon.  At least tell me something about them.Son:  Uh, they were REALLY GOOD!  Delicious!Well, there you have it.  If I had gotten a chance to try them, you would have gotten a more thoughtful and nuanced review (covering chewiness and sweetness and all sorts of other attributes), but you know what?  Maybe with a product like this, a simple enthusiastic declaration is the best endorsement.So, that's the opinion I'm filing here:  They were really good and delicious.I'm sure I'll agree with my kid's opinion when I eventually taste one myself."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The Chewy, Gooey Megafudge cookies, while unhealthy (75 calories and 3.5 grams of fat in each cookie) also are lacking in taste.  The artificially flavored chips are dry and not appealing.  While I wasn't expecting healthy (it is Chips ! cookies after all), I was hoping for at least a tasty cookie to help with the sense of guilt for eating it in the first place.  However, with the dual combination of a poor taste and unhealthiness, I cannot recommend these cookies.The resealable package is a plus (hence the second star) and saves having to use a chip-clip to keep the bag sealed, but you'd be preserving a dry, unappealing cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love cookies and chocolate, but these are gross. They taste to me like chemicals and sugar, and the fudge gooey-ness just means more chemical in my mouth. Ugh."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I tried these cookies and my first impression was rather positive: it's soft, super-chocolate tasting and a nice indulgent snack. Then after just eating two I felt it was a bit much. The cookie really tasted almost too sweet to the point of making me feel rather sick after eating just a few. There was also an odd aftertaste that gave me the feeling that (obviously) there are probably more chemicals packed into this cookie than there are natural, good ingredients. In all, these cookies are just okay but could be improved upon."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These Chips  cookies are as promised: soft and chocolate-filled.  They are very sweet, and the kids love them.  I'll admit that the adults had seconds, too.No, they aren't as good as homemade.  Or as good as premium cookies.  But if you're looking for any kind of standard packaged cookie, you're probably not looking for gourmet."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"We all enjoyed these very chocolatey cookies!  They have a nice chewy texture and gooey center which complement each other well.  They may not be homemade, but they were still great with a glass of milk!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I was excited to try these cookies, because I love Nabisco's oatmeal choco-chips softbaked cookies. The first bite and even the first cookie was okay, but I noticed that it was very sweet.  Also, it wasn't quite as melt-in-my-mouth as I had expected. Instead, these cookies are a little too crumbly (rather than soft like the softbaked ones). That means the cookies weren't very moist, despite the fudge center, which I don't think there was much of anyway. Though I love chocolate, the texture and ultra-sweetness kept me from wanting to return to the box again and again. After two weeks, even with six people in the house, the box was still unfinished."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I thought this Chips  Chewy Gooey Megafudge product was pretty darn good. I was afraid that it would be too ""chocolaty"" or too sweet, but it's actually a pretty good balance. A few minor complaints is that the dough on the cookie crumbles a bit easily... especially around the edges. I would've liked it more cohesive. Also, the ""fudge"" core wasn't quite creamy enough, as far as the texture is concerned. The fudge also would've been better if it tasted more like ""dark chocolate"", but instead it tastes more like hot cocoa. Despite these observations, I think these are pretty delicious cookies and definitely worth a try."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Are you a chocolate lover?  I know, who isn't?  Well, this cookie is for you!  Who didn't grow up on Chips  cookies?  They were one of my favorites growing up.  And through the years Nabisco tweaked the original chocolate chip delight.  I remember when Chewy Chips  hit the market.  They quickly replaced the hard cookie I knew and loved.  There have been many variations of the chewy version through the years, and this one takes the cake.  A soft chocolate cookie, with a fudge center, accented by white and chocolate fudge chips.  The perfect cookie for the price point.  What are you waiting for?"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"One things for certain---the product description doesn's lie: these cookies ARE chewy, gooey, and packed with fudge.They are also far too sweet for an adult palate and the chewy texture makes them more brownie-like than you might enjoy.  Why not just have a brownie instead?That said, my 3-yr-old with the massive sweet tooth went through them like Sherman through Atlanta."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies, while VERY chocolatey, have an artificial taste to them.  As the package promises, they are gooey...but not really moist as one would expect...the outer part is kind of dry and crumbly feeling in the mouth.  Not the worst cookie I've ever tasted, but I'll have no problem leaving these on the shelf!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love everything about these cookies. They are ultra-rich and if you're a chocoholic, they'll be right up your alley.The flavor is good with no weird off-tastes like you get sometimes with such products. I also like the consistency. I tried dipping these munchies in both coffee and milk -- they're a winner either way.You want chocolate? You won't get hurt on those great cookies.Recommended."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"but ""Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge"" is TOO MUCH chocolate.  Seriously.  Milk doesn't even help.  In moments of weakness, I have been known to eat a whole package of chocolate chip cookies, with chocolate milk.  I was barely able to eat two of these goo-balls.  On one hand, maybe that's a good thing - it forced me to moderation.  But the truth is, I really didn't like them that much.Oh sure, they are chocolate, and that's really never a bad thing!  But these are just too much for my tastes.  The description is accurate:  they are chewy, they are gooey, they are fudge.  Basically, they are the Chips  chewy fudge cookies, slit open and filled with gooey fudge in the middle.Not bad - just WAY too far over the top for my taste."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These should be amazing.  Really, just look at that picture!  A chocolate chip cookie that is chewy on the outside and full of creamy fudge.  Good glory, I could go into a happy coma just thinking about it.Unfortunately, they are not so good.  The fudgey middle is actually just a bigger chocolate chip, and the cookie is more crumbly and dry than chewy.  The taste is heavily dominated by all of that chocolate, and the chocolate, while not bad, is not good enough to stand on its own.Don't break your heart by buying these.  Just look at the picture and dream.  If you must, but the Chocofudge variety instead.  I have eaten both (nom nom *cry* nom nom) and the Megafudge surprisingly has less flavor."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I was expecting something that tasted more like the traditional CHIPS AHOY brand cookie.....This is something akin to a Frankensteinian mishmash of SOFT BATCH cookies and semi-hard fudge. The cookie itself isn't bad, but it's amazingly crumbly. The few packages I tried were practically all crumbs, with very few whole cookies in them. The fudge center was FAR from ""Gooey"", it was more like a melted piece of hard fudge. The concept is nice, but the execution is terrible......"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Chips  Chewy Gooey Megafudge Cookies. The name pretty much says it all. These fudge filled soft cookies are really chewy, gooey and full of fudgy morsels. They taste like a premium cookie that you'd buy at a bakery. Along with the great rich chocolate pieces you will also find small white chocolate chips also. The cookies are a smaller size, approximately two inches in diameter, which makes eating them neater than a larger cookie. Because of the softness, they do not break apart and crumble as other cookies often do either.The cookies are packaged in a convenient reclosable container which actually reseals itself very well (unlike some that I have tried to use). I opened and resealed the package at least six or seven times, and each time it completely closed and the cookies remained as fresh as the first time the package was opened.At 150 calories per two cookies, these are not a diet friendly product, but if you can possibly limit yourself to just two cookies (which is hard to do), you should be able to satisfy your sweet tooth and still keep your waistline in tact.I would certainly buy these cookies again and again. The taste is so good that they really could compete with cookies from a bakery."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"It is not often that I get excited over a store bought cookie, but....  THESE ARE GREAT!  They are moist, chewy and above all... very Chocolaty!  Chips  did a great job of putting everything in a snack cookie that I am looking for.  If you love chocolate and are looking for that perfect companion to a cup of coffee or a cold glass of milk, this is your cookie.  I found myself wishing for a bigger package."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"When you eat a Chips  Chewy cookie, you anticipate a certain texture and flavor.  This cookie does not have either.The texture was the thing I noticed first.  Yes, the cookie is chewy.  Yes, there is a vague moistness to the middle, which has creamy chocolate.  However, the cookie, as chewy as it is, had an unpleasant, dry texture to me.  I know, how can a cookie be chewy and dry at the same time?  I have no good answers.What I do know is that I tried these cookies on several different occasions.  I also had one other person try these cookies, and that person's opinion was identical to mine.  I also noticed that these cookies broke easily, suggesting that the dryness was more than the perception of my tongue.Was there anything positive about these cookies?  Yes, these cookies had several positive aspects, though those aspects failed to overcome the texture.  The thing I liked the most was the chunks of white chocolate.  The chunks tasted like nuts to me, and they were the best thing about the cookie.  I also liked that the cookies were chewy, even though the level of moisture seemed insufficient to me.  Lastly, I thought there was a reasonable taste of chocolate in the cookie.With all these positive aspects, the thing that bothered me most is that this cookie did not taste like a Chips  Chewy cookie.  The taste was just okay.  I am a big fan of Chips  Chewy cookies and I love the way they taste.  These cookies fell short of what I expect from a Chips  Chewy cookie.  Rather, the cookie tasted like an imitation or perhaps a cheap generic brand to me.There is a lot of competition in the cookie aisle.  There has to be 100 or more varieties of cookies available.  A new cookie, such as this one, should be phenomenally good to be able to win customers away from competing brands.  However, this cookie is not phenomenally good.  I predict that either this cookie will disappear from store shelves or its formula will change.  In the meantime, you may avoid this cookie in favor of the other, better choices that exist.Good luck!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The Chewy Gooey Megafudge from Chips  was all right, but I certainly thought it could have been better. I didn't notice any real chocolate chips, and the cookies seemed very dry. The taste was just acceptable. I think  that I could go to the store and find something I liked better, probably at a lower price."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Okay, they may not be the ones mom used to make, that you could smell baking from half a block away as I walked home from school (and yes, it was uphill both ways), but for pre-packaged cookies, these are very good indeed. Soft and chewy, they are great for dunking but don't require it like those rock-hard ones do. And they benefit greatly from 5 or so seconds in the microwave."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I am a sucker for sweet goodness.  I especially like soft cookie and when you combine fudge and gooey it is hard to go wrong.  Unfortunately I do believe something went wrong here.  The cookie is not the same consistency throughout.  It is more brittle on the inside than the outside.  The fudge is not particularly gooey and is rather flakey and not very sweet.  Counteract that with the cookie itself being more sweet than the fudge and I am not sure what to make of the cookie.  Overall not a cookie I will try again.  Definitely not best in class."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"There aren't many cookies I don't like, so I may not be as objective as some people, but this cookie has great flavor. The only complaint I have about these Gooey Megafudge cookies is that they are a little dry. Nothing a little milk can't take care of though!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"one expects actual chocolate chips but there aren't any and I expected a softer moister cookie.  Chocolate looking but lack good chocolate taste; neither brownie nor fudge softness. Dry and a bit chalky. Disappointing."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Chocolate chip cookies are a favorite around our house so I was eager to try these out.  My daughter seemed to like them.  Personally I found them a bit dry and really didn't want to eat to many of them. I have had better packaged cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies showed up and when I opened them it looked like somebody else had already been in them.  They were all shaken up and looked a bit beat up.Ok, so that's just how they looked.  That's where it gets a bit odd.  You take a bite and are immediately greeted with a dry-ish, crumbly texture, even though it is still kind of soft. As you chew it, the gooey chocolate inside changes it to a more pleasant texture that I thought tasted okay.  Not great.  But okay.  My wife actually had one of them and declared that she didn't need anymore, because ""it wasn't worth the calories.""  Fair enough.  So, I ate the rest.  However, I don't have plans to buy them any time soon."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"How can something named ""Chewy, Gooey Megafudge"" be so bland and unexciting? I was expecting a decadent treat. I was all set for chewy, gooey, megafudge hedonism. Bring on the megafudge, Chips !What I got was a slightly chocolatey-tasting, soft cookie that is actually pretty dry. The cookies are rather small, perhaps the diameter of a silver dollar. That's fine because I prefer to have something on the smallish side for the occasional treat and although small, these cookies are nice and plump.But the cookies aren't really MEGAfudge at all, more like KINDAfudge. We all know that the picture on the package rarely matches up to the actual contents, but this cookie does not ooze a fudge filling when pulled apart. There is a bit of a creamy chocolate in the center, but these cookies are too small for any substantial amount of actual fudge. And throwing in the white chocolate chips managed to actually take away from the potential chocolatey goodness. Honestly, this cookie rates a ""meh"" on a scale of 1-10. It's not even bad enough to hate. If this cookie were on the free cookie plate by the water cooler at work, I'd eat it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it for myself. Even my husband who is notorious for his sweet tooth said, ""Eh, it's ok. I ate them because they were there.""Another note - this cookie dried out quickly. Nabisco has a great idea with the self-sealing packaging, but neither that nor the fact that I also kept the package wrapped tightly in a Ziploc bag ('cause I'm paranoid like that) protected these cookies from drying out and going stale surprisingly quickly. If you're going to pump all those chemicals into my cookies, I should have fresh tasting cookies for quite a while. These cookies don't last long, and I wonder how they hold up in snack packs that some parents might buy for their kids' lunches?Ok, you don't try something called ""chewy gooey megafudge"" expecting any health benefits, but here are the nutritional facts:Nutrition Facts - 2 cookies - - 150 calories, 60 calories from fat, 7 grams of fat, 3.5 grams of saturated fat, 0 grams of trans fat, 1 gram of polyunsaturated fat, 2 grams of monounsaturated fat, 0 milligrams of cholesterol, 110 milligrams of sodium, 80 milligrams of potassium, 21 grams of carbohydrates, less than 1 gram of fiber, 13 grams of sugar, and 1 grams of protein)Considering how underwhelmed I was by the flavor, texture, and longevity of these cookies, they are just not worth the amount of fat and calories for a couple of small, rather bland cookies.I understand that there is a Chocofudge version of this cookie that is a more traditional chocolate chip cookie with a fudge filling. I'd try those but these KindaFudge cookies will not be in my grocery cart."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I should have known when I selected these packaged treats what they would taste like--overprocessed, high sugar, high calorie discs of nothingness. To compare these to real home baked cookies is like comparing real life to THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY. There may be something to occupy your time for a moment or two, but there's no substance, and certainly no love, underneath the veneer."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Over the years, Chips  has gone from bad to worse.  Although these cookies don't taste bad, they are so small that it's not even worth the calories to eat them.  The package says a serving size is 31g.  How vague is that?  There are only 9 servings per package so that amounts to a few measly cookies.  At the price it's selling for, you'll be paying more for the packaging.But back to the cookie, if you love chocolate, then you are hit with a combination of chocolate cookie with white chocolate chips and a fudge center.  The cookie is not much to speak of but the fudge center tastes good.  Not as gooey as one would expect because the cookie is really small, hence not a lot of filling. I think kids with less discriminating tastes would like it."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Being prediabetic, I don't eat a lot of ""store-boought"" cookies, but I usually taste cookies that my husband buys.  I am quite fond of the regular Chips  cookies and think they are great to use to make ice cream sandwiches.  Being a former chocoholic, I was eager to try these new Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  They did not disappoint!  The reason that I gave them only 4 stars is that they don't come close to tasting like a homemade cookie, which is my ""gold standard.""  My husband, who likes regular Chips  cookies, was not a big fan of the Chewy Gooey Megafudge variety.  His veiw is ""why mess with a good product?""  I believe that this flavor cookie is a nice addition to the Chips  family.  I wouldn't want to give up regular Chips Ahaoy cookies, but if you like chocolate,  you'll probably like the new flavor!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I'll have to hand it to the advertisers: the product is exactly as advertised--- chewy, gooey, and mega in the fudge department. If that's what you like, that's great, but I found these to be cloyingly sweet, and the super-sweetness destroyed what could have been a nice chocolate flavor.The packaging was also strange. The cookies came in rows; seven cookies in one row, three in another, and so on. Not really a problem but very odd.The cookies are very soft and indeed have a very chewy texture. They are packed with truly gooey fudge (have a napkin on hand for these) with lots of chocolate flavor. If only they weren't so terribly sweet, this would be a fine product. As it stands, it's a sugar high--- and a messy one at that--- but not a product that I'd rush out to buy."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm a little skeptical of anything from Chips .  Let's face it, besides Famous Amos they are kind of the lowest common denominator of chocolate chip cookies.  That's what makes this new product such a surprising discovery.  This chocolate chocolate chip cookies with a creamy fudge center are really tasty and almost decadent.  My only complaints is that they tend to fall apart rather easily.Chocoholics take notice and give these a try!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Don't get me wrong, these cookies were good, but when you read 'Chewey Gooey Megafudge' you expect to be WOWed! These cookies were small and chocolaty, with a little creamy fudge filling, but didn't quite live up to the expectations we had from the packaging. Marketers need to be careful not to oversell their product with hype, because consumers have grown to expect more honesty in labeling. ""small chocolate bites with creamy center"" would have been more realistic."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"This cookie was a mix between a gooey, chocolate brownie and a cookie! It doesn't get any better than that with a glass of milk. Love it, and at a decent price."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I wouldn't order these if you live in a warm-weather region and if it's summertime, as the issue I had arose in transportation.  The cookies appeared to have potential, but some of them melted together by the time I opened the package.  Inherently, the flavor was adversely affected, tasting non-distinctive and partially stale.  Perhaps these are okay to buy in the store, but I don't have a precise idea of their potential because of what happened to the package delivered to me."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These are gooey all right--they taste like uncooked cacao.  We were hoping for a chocolatey cookie that wasn't as rock hard as regular Chips-a-Hoy, but ended up getting a cookie that didn't taste entirely baked.  We didn't enjoy these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"wonderful chocolaty-ness with a melt in your mouth softness.  My kids really enjoyed these cookies.  Just the perfect consistency, with a perfect balance of chips and cookie combined."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"My wife and kids LOVED these cookies! They are very tasty and have a nice fudge center. The only complaint is that a good 2/3 of the box was crumbs. This was due to shipping. I suppose if you ordered several boxes at once they would be better cushioned. As part of Vine we received just 1 box and it was fairly beat up.Overall we liked the cookies and would recommend them to chocolate lovers anywhere!Thank you for reading my review."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I would have to say these chips  cookies are pretty good. However, I am disappointed that they do not have more megafudge in them. They taste just like regular chips  cookies with a little bit of gooey fudge in them. If they had more fudge in them then they would be considered megafudge in my opinion. If you like chips  cookies then I think you will like these cookies as well but please don't expect a lot of gooey fudge in the middle. Overall I like the cookies but I deducted one star due to them being called megafudge instead of fudge."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I have been waiting for a packaged soft cookie that can recreate the melted yumminess ofchocolate chips in a fresh baked cookie. Nabisco has mastered the art of creating melted chipswith each bite, but that is as far as it goes.The overall goodness of this cookie is lacking- it tastes like a packaged cookie. Its softnessfools you into thinking fresh baked, yet when you take a bite, you are quickly reminded of thepreservatives that must be contained in each cookie.The cookie is not at all the size represented on the packaging. It is considerably smaller. Onceyou pick one up to eat, it crumbles into several pieces. Basically, it falls apart before you caneven take a bite.The packaging does contain a freshness seal so that after you open the pack, you will be able toreseal to ensure freshness.This cookie is getting two stars simply because I love the concept of melted chips in a packagedcookie but I think the title ""Chewy"" is a bit of a stretch. The more appropriate title would beCCCC-Crumbly Chocolate Chip Cookies!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"First off - these don't ship well.  When I recieved my package (even though it was clearly sealed and had not been opened) it looked like there were several cookies missing, there was a lot of empty space in the package allowing the cookies that were in there to slide all over, and several were broken as a result.  If you really REALLY want to try these, I would look for them at the local store rather than buy online and have them shipped.That being said....I'm awfully glad I didn't actually pay for these.  I've never been a fan of Chips  cookies - even as a kid.  They're just so over-processed and artificial tasting.  I was hoping the extra blob of fudge in these might help make up for that, but not really.  I can't justify buying awful-tasting cookies when it's not that difficult to make your own, or even to buy from a local bakery which tastes a million times better and fresher.I cannot recommend these - they were not packaged well, and did not taste any better than I expected."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Not nearly as good as original Chips  or chewey Chips .  The cookies are very dry and crumbly.  The chocolate flavor is off - too artificial."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Although I really really really didn't like these, my kids didn't feel the same.  They liked the flavor and the texture and I hated both.  There was a strange chemical taste, perhaps from the preservatives needed to keep them soft. This flavor is the same as that in the other soft Chips  cookies so if you like those you may like these as well.  I like the crunchy Chips  much better."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"QUICK SUMMARY:  This highly fudgey cookie is addictive and was gobbled up at a party in no time.  However, the cookies themselves are relatively small (just slightly larger than a Thin Mint or Oreo in diameter), and I/we did note a chemical taste not unlike that found in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OXIZOE"">Chips  Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</a>.  You'll go through a package quickly both because of the deliciousness and that you really only get 15-18 relatively small cookies.  More details follow...PACKAGING:(Note - I received this product through the Vine program and it is possible that packaging will change between the review version and final launch.)The outer wrap is a relatively standard Chips  pack.  Opening it involves lifting a tab on the front, which reveals three rows of cookies.  While the cookies in my package were intact, I was initially shocked by how much air is in the package.  Nabisco clearly re-used the tray from other cookie products, and these cookies do not fill the space.  As such, they're probably prone to bounce around and crumble if treated poorly in shipment.  The package can be re-sealed by pressing the flap back down and running a finger along the edge to adhere.  The cookies didn't last long enough for me to judge whether the package truly prevents the cookies from becoming stale.  The seal seems a little looser than I'd like.VISUAL IMPRESSION:The cookies look kind of shabby, to be honest.  They don't look like they'd be very chocolaty.  Also, the smaller size is quite striking if you're used to the size of a standard Chips .  (This smaller size likely accounts for the large amount of airspace in the packaging.)FLAVOR:I was blown away by the taste of these.  While there is a slight chemical taste, it is the same chemical taste found in any soft-style packaged cookie.  The chemical taste is quickly replaced by an explosion of chocolate.  One guest I shared these with noted that the cookie tasted a S'more minus the marshmallow. (Idea for Nabisco: S'more flavor!)  I was initially concerned that the cookie would be too sweet, but the chocolate filling is kind of dark and semi-sweet which compliments the cookie perfectly.  The cookies are also quite rich, and I found myself satisfied after a smaller quantity of cookies than normal.NUTRITION:Well, it's a cookie.  You shouldn't be expecting a health food here.  It's 150 calories per serving, and a serving is roughly 2 cookies.  That seems fairly calorie-dense to me, but your perception may vary. Each serving has 21g of carbs, with 13g of those coming from sugar.  There's no trans-fats, and the ingredients list sugar, not HFCS, as the main sweetening ingredient.QUANTITY/VALUE:At $4.32 a package, that's roughly 24-28 cents a cookie or around 50-56 cents a serving (2 cookies).  While I didn't pay for this product directly, I have to say that I would not pay over $4 per package for these given the low quantity of cookies.  I'd watch for a sale or lower price."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"This is an interesting concept in a packaged cookie:  a chocolate chip cookie with a soft chocolate center.  The cookies are small, which is a big plus in my book (easy portion control).Personally, I liked the flavor and texture of the cookie better after heating it in the microwave for about 9 seconds.  Then, it tasted more like a just-baked chocolate chip cookie, when the chocolate chips are still melted, soft, and smooth.For me, these cookies were just a trifle too sweet, but others in my family liked them & children LOVED them, so I'll go with the majority & give them 4 stars for inventiveness.If you have young kids, they'll like these!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm particularly fond of soft chocolate chip cookies, so I never really enjoyed the regular Chips  cookies. I prefer my cookies moist and chewy.  Because they're chewy and not too sweet, I really enjoyed the new Chewy Gooey Chocofudge Chips .  They come close to fresh baked in taste and texture.  Though they're quite high in calories, so I'll just have to try not to eat too many at any one sitting."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"My only complaint is that there are not enough of them in one bag :) These fudgy filled chocolate chip cookies will satisfy your chocolate craving in the traditional feel and texture of Chips , with an extra chocolaty filling. Recommended if you like Chips  chewy cookies and want an extra level of chocolate."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Lately Nabisco has been branding new products as new ""styles"" of existing products including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LA1LKI"">""Ritz""</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEJ968"">""Newtons""</a> brands. Those products, while tasty, had little resemblance to the original products. These, however, are a logical extension of the ""Chips !"" brand.As far as the product itself, they are cookies. I don't expect them to have any healthy ingredients. I don't care what they are made of or how many calories they have.First impression: They are about 2"" in diameter and have a dark, almost burnt look. The aroma is overwhelmingly sweet and of chocolate and vanilla.When the least bit warm, they are falling apart soft and melty. They firmed up when cooled down. The small chip bits in the cookie were almost an unnecessary addition, in my opinion. The center is not not gooey, but grainy, and almost crunchy.To me there was an overpowering fake chocolate taste, and an aftertaste that hung on far too long.All in all, I am not enamored enough with these to purchase them. They are too fragile and overpoweringly sweet for my taste."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I usually love Chips  products, but not these. The chocolate had a very funky aftertaste. I have to wonder if they were somehow affected by shipment, but I probably wouldn't chance buying them at the store. I usually don't have a problem with any type of cookie, but I gave these to my dad."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Whoever Photoshopped the cookie on the front of the package is a true talent and should probably help the bakers make something that looked similar. The cookies are much smaller and a lot less attractive than the illustration, but to be fair, they're not much different or any smaller than other Chewy Chips ! cookies.So once you get past the visible let down, the taste is at least on par or better than any other Chewy Chips ! cookie, plus it has the benefit of having chocolate in every bite. So if you like Chips ! and you like chocolate these will not disappoint you at all."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"When I first opened these I was surprised by how small they were and also how many were broken. They are very crumbly so they fall apart easily.  I wasn't impressed by the taste, it's a chewy cookie with fudge in the middle, but you can tell it's not quality chocolate, just has a bland kind of taste.  My 5 year old seemed to enjoy them, but I wouldn't buy them again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"My wife and I have had a craving for some soft chocolate chip cookies, but both Chips 's and Keebler's didn't really hit the spot.  Then these came along.  They're kind of amazing due to the layer of fudge that is dispersed throughout the cookie's center.  It makes the cookie soft and chocolatey.To top it off, they ditched the High Fructose Corn Syrup for good ole' fashioned sugar. HFCS has been linked to obesity and certain sources have been found to be contaminated with mercury so I try to avoid it if I can.  It's good to see that snack makers are catching on.So, these may not be the greatest soft cookies around, but they are certainly high up on my list of store-bought soft cookies.  Mixed with ice cream, it's a seriously tasty treat.  I recommend."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Word of warning: I found these cookies to have a very strong ""chemical"" taste that made them near-inedible.  They weren't as bad as a lot of other prepackaged cookies I've had in the past, but they still had a very strong chemical taste that made them distinctly unappealing. If you're the sort of person who prefers more organic products, I'd stay clear of these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"See that ooey gooey chocolate stretching between the two pieces of cookie on bag? That doesn't happen, even when the cookies are warm. The chocolate is actually quite stiff and dry. Another one of those ""got milk?"" products. I like plain old Chips  and would stick with those before diving into these and being disappointed again.And I'm not alone -- people in my office weren't impressed either -- and we'll eat anything."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Whether or not you can bite into one of these Chips  cookies and enjoy a burst of gooey fudge is unknown to me because most of them were broken in shipping. However, I did eat the bigger pieces and they were fine, tasting a bit heavier on the chocolate than the conventional Chips  cookies I'm familiar."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Definitely a winner. There are two of us in this household, both seasoned cookie fans, and we tore through this package in almost no time (even though we're on a diet!). They don't taste as much like regular Chips  as I had thought; the chocolate in the center actually overpowers that flavor a good deal. Still, this was no bad thing, and they stand alone as their own tastiness."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are pretty good for a store-bought cookie.  Obviously, homemade cookies will always be better, but for a pre-packaged cookie, these Chips ! Chocofudge Cookies are pretty good.  I noted that they were perfectly soft right out of the package, and also pretty tasty.I'm now going to compare them to the original Chips ! Chocolate Chip cookies.  In terms of softness, these are much softer right out of the package than the original Chocolate Chip cookies.  The original Chocolate Chip cookies can be made very soft and nice if you stick them in the microwave for a little while, but the Chocofudge cookies are soft right out of the package.  I think the Chocofudge cookies are better tasting right out of the package too.  I also tested both in the microwave, and the Chocofudge cookies were also tastier this way.I do need to talk about price points though.  The Chocofudge cookies are pretty close to the same price as the original Chocolate Chip cookies in the stores that I checked, BUT you get much less quantity-wise from the Chocofudge cookie package.  In fact, the original Chocolate Chip cookies have about 5 oz. more cookies in them.  Of course, the fudge filling probably makes them a bit more expensive to manufacture, which would account for this marketing strategy, but do be aware of this if you're a big fan of the originals and you're thinking about switching to the Chocofudge variety.Well, that's about all I've got to say about these cookies.  They are fairly tasty for a packaged snack and they are pretty soft, which isn't common for store-bought cookies of any kind.  If you are a fan of the Chips ! brand, you'll probably love this new Chocofudge variety.  Just go ahead and give them a try!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I've ALWAYS been partial to chips  because of their soft chewy cookies, but these are truly awesome. Well worth the money. I wish they made a sugar free version with stevia though."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"When you first pick up a package of Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocolate Fudge Cookies you may be a bit surprised at how light the package is - only 10 ounces - but don't be deceived.  The package may be light but it is filled with delicious cookies.  The cookies are on the small part - you can easily finish one in two bites - but they are yummy.  While the cookies aren't as gooey as advertised (they aren't messy to eat at all), they are indeed fudge filled - break a cookie in half and all you see is fudge.  In fact, there seems to be more fudge than cookie (there are chocolate chips on the cookies but I couldn't really taste them).  However, the fudge taste is never overwhelming - the combination of cookie and fudge is delicious.  I love the resealable package that keeps the cookies fresh although the cookies are so good they won't last long in my house and there's little chance they'll go stale.Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocolate Fudge Cookies are a tasty treat.Nutrition facts (serving size two cookies): calories 150 (calories from fat 60);  total fat - 11% daily value; saturated fat - 18% daily value; sodium - 5% daily value; potassium - 2% daily value; total carbohydrates - 7% daily value; dietary fiber - 3% daily value; iron 4%."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"it sounds good, chocolate chip cookies with a gooey chocolate center - what's not to like?  the reality was a mushy, piece of chocolate ganache that was coated in a thick, overly moist layer of cookie crumbs.  it was fine, but nothing spectacular."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I've always liked Chips ! cookies and was excited to try these ""gooey"" ones!!  What could be better with chocolate chip cookies than more chocolate?  Unfortunately, for me, they just fell flat.  The chocolate ""gooey"" part was not very soft or, well, gooey and there wasn't much flavor to it, in my opinion.  I actually felt that it took away from the taste of the cookie as a whole.  I would have preferred eating a normal blue package chocolate chip cookie!!That being said, however, my late teen recently graduated high school son's friend LOVED the cookies!!  In fact, he asked if he could take them home as they were driving up north that weekend!  He felt they were delicious!So maybe it is my more mature taste buds, but these would definitely be a hit with teens!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"""Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge,"" I liked these cookies. During the summer these are easy to prepare, just open the bag. I liked the fudge center. No summer oven heat. This could be real good crumbled on ice cream and put in the microwave for one second. It was very good for summer.  I like to play with mixing flavors."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love chocolate chip cookies. The upside of these is that they are soft, and the chocolate in the middle makes them extra decadent. They are also the perfect two-bite size, in my opinion. The only downside is a little bit of a chemical taste, probably from the stuff that keeps them soft."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE COOKIESWe love cookies and were excited to received these.  They are chock full of chocolate chips, extremely soft, definitely chewy, and for an added treat, there is a filling of chocolate fudge.  The only down side regarding these cookies are perhaps they are a little too soft -- when taking them out of the package to enjoy many of them simply fell apart in my hand.The packaging is attractive and eye-catching and has the new lift-end resealable package.  I find this type of packaging an easy opener, but always find the package does not stay sealed well and end up placing all the cookies in a plastic container or placing the entire package of cookies in a food storage bag to keep fresh.These cookies are good -- I don't think Chips ! ever disappoints.  However, they are not my favorite Chips ! cookie, [that would be the regular old plain chocoloate chip non-chewy, thank you] but they are worth every bite and every calorie.  For those of you watching calories, fat, sodium, etc -- you may enjoy two cookies for a total of 150 calories, total fat is seven grams, zero cholesterol, and sodium clocks in at 110mg.  There is no trans fat involved.  So you should definitely have more than two cookies -- go for it!If you like chocolate chip cookies and fudge, these cookies make for a nice combo.  They are delicious with a hot cup of coffee or tea or a tall ice cold glass of milk.  Dunking in milk was a bit sloppy since the cookies are so soft,  yet still highly recommended.All in all, not a bad cookie.Thank you.Pam"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm already a fan of Chips  and if you love cookie dough, this one is for you! The middle is a nice chocolate center. It isn't dripping with gooey chocolate, but it is nice and soft - as if straight out of the oven. I didn't think they could improve on the soft Chips  but they certainly did!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I only feel ho-hum about these cookies. They seem like they are really more of a vessel for chocolate rather than a cookie. It seems that there is barely any of the chewy cookie and what is there doesn't have enough cookie flavor to it. The cookies are overwhelmed by the amount of chocolate in them.They also seemed a bit overpriced for a small package. Even though the outside package is about the same size as the regular chewy cookies, there are a few ounces less of actual product and a bit more packaging. I also found them in my local store for almost half the price listed here on Amazon.I found the cookies to be okay and easily finished off the package in a few days. My husband didn't care for them, so I have no one else to blame for eating all of the cookies. He prefers the regular Chips  cookies (non-chewy) and I found that I do, too. I saw these at the store and did not buy them after having tried them from Amazon. I don't see myself picking these up at my local store at any time even with a lower price.These cookies just didn't work for me."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are, as promised, chewy.  That's definitely their selling point.  The cookies feature a gooey chocolate core.  The cookies are not especially thick, but there's definitely a gooey layer in there.  These are VERY chocolatey cookies.  If you don't like a lot of chocolate, these are probably not the cookies for you.  That's not an issue for me.These are still no match for a homemade chocolate chip cookie, but if you're not inclined to bake, this is a reasonably good substitute."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I would say ""chewy gooey"" is taking it a little too far but the cookies are soft. I prefer them over the regular hard Chips  from my childhood. I like that they just have sugar instead of corn syrup. They are REALLY sweet though. It's a good thing that they're on the small side so it's not too overwhelming eating all that sugar. For the popular brands of cookies, this one is pretty good.The packaging has a nice feature where you can pull open the package from the front left side and reseal it so the cookies don't get stale."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I received these cookies as a sample to try out and I would have to say that I would consider these for purchase.  The cookies are billed as ""gooey"" cookies.  They aren't the most gooey inside cookies.  I would say that each cookie is bigger than a quarter but smaller than a silver dollar.  Somehow I remember Chips from my youth being bigger.  No matter, the cookies are still delicious.After I sampled the cookies, I put them out in the office breakroom and gave them a test.  Anything that lasts in the breakroom until noon is not that great.  These cookies didn't make in until 10am.  My co-workers loved them.I checked to see if there were any transfats in these cookies and didn't see any hydrogenated fats.  I might have missed something but it looks like they are transfat free.  Maybe I'd have to re-read the packaging but they looked solid."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are chewy and soft, but the inside layer is more like solid chocolate instead of creamy. The new packaging means you peel back the top layer of the package, one compartment at a time. The only problem is the cookies shift around and there were only two cookies in the front because they had slipped to the back. None were broken however. Despite the solid inner layer and the packaging, the cookies tasted good. I just think there were too few cookies for the size package."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies are okay but they certainly aren't as good as the ""Megafudge"" ones which actually has a chocolate cookie.  Those cookies I loved but there seems to be something lacking in these cookies.  The flavor isn't as good and they don't smell all that wonderful either.I love the whole idea of the Chewy Gooey cookies and would recommend the Megafudge ones a lot higher than these Chocofudge ones."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I was afraid the chocolatey center to this cookie would simply overpower the cookie part and be mostly a big mouthful of chocolate . . . I was pleasantly surprised to find that the smooth center complimented the cookie part rather well, not too strong and a nice, smooth consistency.  I wouldn't pass these up as a snack for a road trip in a gas station or had an insatiable hankering for a cookie and didn't have time to bake my own but, frankly, there's nothin' like a homemade cookie and these don't come close to comparing."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies were more choco-fudge than cookies. I found them tasty and easy to chew. They did have a slight artificial taste to them and do contain palm oil, the ingredient that is harvested from the rain forests, but for store bought cookies, I liked them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I was happy to get the chance to sample these ""Chewy Gooey Chocofudge"" cookies, but I'm sorry to report that they aren't so great, IMO.  The fudge filling is relatively tasty, but the cookie part has an odd artificial flavor that I didn't care for.  I know there's no substitute for homemade cookies, but I'd like the fact that a brand-name cookie is factory-made to be less obvious."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"While my younger self would swear up and down that no such thing would ever be uttered, much less typed, regarding the amount of sugar in a snack, I have to disappoint that little boy I used to be. These cookies are indeed good, but they are just over the line of being too sweet to become a regular purchase. The standard chewy Chips  cookies are pretty darn close to being perfect. Adding in a fudge center might sound like a good idea, but it just ratchets up the sweetness. Don't get me wrong, the fudge is entirely too good, as is the cookie. It's just the injection of one into the other that makes it a bit too sweet for my aging palate. Nevertheless, in moderation, which is to say one to two cookies at a sitting instead of a half-dozen of the non-stuffed variety, is a nice capper to a packed lunch at work (just as it would be in a bag lunch for a school kid). I think this is a case of trying to improve perfection and falling a bit short of the original product. Kudos on the effort, but I will return to the prior incarnation."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The sweet-tooth in me took over at the mid-way mark of the commercial. DOH!!! I have to wonder if the advertising department has ever tried this cookie... it was chewy, soft, even mushy, but the center was a HUGE let down, can't see myself buying another box/bag. They were sweet, too sweet, it really wasn't a good sweet, more of a so sweet there's an aftertaste sweet. Might need to go back to the drawing board on this cookie... and quick... no point in pushing the envelope as to what your patrons will put up with in terms of deceptive advertising... Short of it... the cookie's a flop and the ad doesn't represent the actual end users product experience!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Children who can consume sweets by the pound will gladly go through a box of these with no issue.  My friend, an adult male who occasionally feels the need to snack - took about two days to consume the box of these.  These had the appearance of a smaller, thicker chips- chewy cookies.I personally didn't care for them, they were smaller than normal chips  cookies, and seemed damp.  The fudgy center didn't really seem fudgy at all but rather made the cookie seem more cakey.  The sweetness however was really kicked up a notch - they were so sweet it was almost painful.  Although this cookie seemed like a great idea, I'll stick with the chips- chewy cookies personally. These were too sweet for me and the dampness was just sort of strange and a bit unnerving.From a kid's perspective these are probably the greatest cookies available in a store (everyone knows that mom's and Grandma's cookies are the best).  But the majority of adults would probably prefer the original or chewy cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I loved the ""gooey"" cookie line when they first came out. This edition has a nice chocolate-ish flavor but there's nothing 'chewy' about it. The cookie is too gooey to have a texture and all the cookies within the same compartment just smooshed together forming a cookie blob. This brings up the best use for a package of these cookies--if parents of a preschooler have ticked you off, give their kid a package of CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE..and tell the little angel to make a monster cookie blob to eat and play with! If you are still of an age to play with your food this would be the cookie of choice to smear on the walls and mash on your face.(Seems kind harsh on the parents--if they have a preschooler, don't you think they've been punished enough?)The other ""issue"" is the crumbs. These cookies don't stand up to the rigors of the real world. About one third of the mass of the cookies in each compartment was disintegrated into crumbs. The crumbs don't have much flavor and they won't stick to the walls. What's the state of junk food coming to?No nutritional value, great sugar buzz and a high potential to make a mess--what's not to love here?"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"This are quite tasty cookies.  They have a fudge center and are very soft.  My only complaint is that they have a slightly artificial taste which is to be expected, I suppose.  While these are no replacement for fresh home baked cookies, they are a convenient substitute."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I eagerly anticipated these cookies.  Every once in a while I crave chocolate, the richer the better.  And what sounds better than a soft chocolate chip cookie, with a fudge center? Just apply those calories straight to my hips!At first I was not very fond of these cookies.  They do have an oddly artifical taste, and the chocolate is definitely not the highest in quality.  The fudge, instead of being ""gooey"" is actually a bit brittle and hard.  I took a bite and chucked the rest of the cookie.  At 75 calories and 3.5g fat for one itty bitty cookie, it's just not worth it.  However, I happened to leave a plate of these on our deck for my husband, thinking he'd like them more than I did.  What can I say, I couldn't help one more trial bite! After warming in the sun, the fudge center actually did become soft and gooey - much better!Overall, I'd sneak one if I happened upon a plate sitting out on the deck.  I would not go out of my way to purchase or eat these cookies otherwise, however.  For that kind of apply-to-bum calorie content, I'd go for an actual bite of quality chocolate."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I was so excited to get these cookies from the vine program.  I had seen the commericals on t.v., and I thought they looked yummy.  When I received the cookies, a lot of them were broken and/or stuck together.  The ""gooey"" aspect wasn't gooey but one big chip  of chocolate in the middle.  To me, they were too sweet and not the best quality of chocolate.  I am not a huge fan of the original, but I prefer them to this new cookie.  I would not buy these, but on a side note, my four year old and two year old seemed to like them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"but ""Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge"" is TOO MUCH chocolate.  Seriously.  Milk doesn't even help.  In moments of weakness, I have been known to eat a whole package of chocolate chip cookies, with chocolate milk.  I was barely able to eat two of these goo-balls.  On one hand, maybe that's a good thing - it forced me to moderation.  But the truth is, I really didn't like them that much.Oh sure, they are chocolate, and that's really never a bad thing!  But these are just too much for my tastes.  The description is accurate:  they are chewy, they are gooey, they are chocofudge.  Basically, they are the Chips  chewy chocolate chip cookies, slit open and filled with gooey fudge in the middle.Not bad - just WAY too far over the top for my taste."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"If you want a chocolate bar, you should probably buy one.If you want chocolate chip cookie ice cream buy that,but I suggest if you want chocolate chip cookies,you should try another kind of cookie.Sort of an half baked cookie effect makes thesecookies although tasting very good,something you will eat too many off and too fast,both of which are not very healthy or desirable."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge / B004U43ZO0I received these cookies and their extra-chocolate counterparts at the same time, and I'm a little disappointed with both.I was skeptical that packaged cookies would be soft, but these cookies actually are very soft around the edges. Unfortunately, the mouth-feel is very unpleasant to me: they feel a little like wet bread in my mouth. Once the edges have fallen off, you hit the center core of fudge -- it's basically a hard chocolate disk inside the cookie that needs warming for a second or two in the microwave beforehand.These aren't the worst cookies I've ever eaten, but I didn't enjoy them at all and really wanted to throw them away after the first few had been eaten -- there's a strange aftertaste that I don't much care for. There's also a bit of a ""fake chocolate"" smell to the cookies that is unpleasant -- my husband took one sniff of each package and refused to try any, saying that they ""smelled bad"".I really like the idea these cookies represent, and I hope that Chips  can get the recipe right in their next attempt -- it's a good idea, but just doesn't quite come together in execution.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I haven't had a Chips  cookie in many, many, many years, so I honestly didn't know what to expect when I got these cookies.  Upon opening the (convenient and resealable) package, I saw many tiny cookies.  Each one is only a little over an inch in diameter, which is both a blessing and a curse:  being so small, you'll have to fight the impulse to eat a whole handful of them, knowing that the serving size is only two cookies (150 calories and 7 grams of fat per serving); however, the cookies are rich, so once you eat the requisite two cookies, you'll find yourself without the desire to eat any more.  The cookies themselves are soft and very sweet (13 grams of sugar per serving); the gooey center is less goo and more like a smear of chocolate.  It doesn't flow or ooze or look anything like the commercial makes it out to be.  I suppose if you wanted the center to be gooey, you could warm the cookie in the microwave for a few seconds; however, that would also make the rest of the cookie gooey as well, which kinda defeats the purpose.  On the downside, there's a slight metallic flavor to the cookie, along with a rather artificial taste; I don't know if all Chips  have that or if it's only limited to this particular type of cookie.  However, it's rather off-putting.  Normally, when I'm looking for a cookie fix, I buy the kind you can buy from a bakery, which has usually been freshly made just that morning, making the artificial aspect of the Chips  cookie even more pronounced.  Which is strange considering the ingredient list.  It's less offensive than most:  the ingredients are straight-forward and easy to pronounce, with none of the polysyllabic products which make one wonder if what's in the package is actual food and not, say, some sort of food-shaped plastic.  However, taken all together, unless I'm in the middle of a serious cookie craving and no other option is available, I won't be eating Chips  Chewy Gooey cookies again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"This was a good cookie. Not quite fudge tasting. More like a somewhat underbaked cookie out of the oven with melted choco chips. My daughter loves these type of cookies. I like crispy overbaked cookies and prefer the original crispy Chips . I do believe that this cookie will appeal to most consumers and would recommend it be purchased."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are soft, but not really chewy. They are more crumbly than chewy. They are chocolate chip cookies with a core of soft chocolate. Tasty, but very sweet and a little salty. Definitely for a chocolate lover. The chocolate may be little overpowering. They leave you thirsty, so you'll want something to drink available. They go great with milk. The cookies are smaller than your average Chips ! The cookies got a little beat up in the mail, but for the most part they held up well. Not my favorite, but still very enjoyable."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Just as described.  These are small cookies with a sweet and chewy center.  A tad too sweet for my taste, and there's a bit of an aftertaste, but they do make for a good afternoon snack."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Let's be honest.  If you are buying these, you are probably not buying them for yourself.  You are probably buying them for youngsters.  So, here is what you need to know.  These are basically just soft chocolate chip cookies.  The ""gooey center"" is only marginally noticeable, and it barely tastes like fudge.  However, kids seem to like them.  There are two up-sides to this product.  First, the cookies are quite small, which makes it easy to manage portions.  Second, the resealable package actually seems to work.  There is nothing special about these cookies.  Kids seem to like them, but kids will pretty much eat anything with sugar.  When you sneak a couple, you won't wind up with stale, hard cookies, but don't expect gourmet."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"We were very excited to try these cookies, since the kids had already seen the commercials. Our daughter especially loves Chips , especially the soft ones. My first impression when eating one of these new cookies -- besides how small each cookie seems compared to the picture -- was that they're kind of like chocolate fig newtons. My wife was not thrilled with the aftertaste, much the the ""presentaste."" These cookies are okay, but not outstanding enough to make us changes from the Chips  we already buy and enjoy."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"To me, these taste no different from the regular Chips ! chewy cookies. They have a very thin layer of ""fudge"" in the center, but it isn't gooey as the pictures show. It's similar to a layer of chocolate chips. The cookies taste like regular chocolate chip cookies, just with a little extra chocolate inside. The cookies themselves are pretty small, they're soft and moist, and they have a lot of chocolate in them. If you like regular soft Chips ! cookies, then you might very well like these. I'm not much of a fan, however, and I probably would not buy these at the store if given any sort of option."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm a long time fan of the original Chip  cookies; I've like them since I was a kid. I've also had the soft Chips , which are OK but still not as good as the original. So, when I set out to review Chewy Gooey Chocofudge, my expectations were not high, but I didn't expect them to taste THAT bad.In order to give a fair and balanced review, I sought help from two others: My mom and my teenage daughter. Mom and I were on the same page, not good. Certainly not horrible, but just not good. We are both experienced cookie bakers and both know that its very difficult for mass produced cookies to match up with home baked. We did take this into consideration.Number one: The cookies were somewhat soft, but they also crumbled when taking bites; ""chewy"" cookies are not suppose to do that. They were hardly ""gooey"". There is a bit fudge in the center, but gooey means that it pulls like hot cheese on a pizza. So, Nabisco, don't claim gooey if they're not! Finally, once swallowed, both my mom and I experienced an unpleasant and lingering aftertaste. Yucky to say the least.My daughter, though, thought they were wonderful! Or to quote, ""They're da bomb!"" So, I'll just take that as a five star review.Me: 2 starsMom: 2 starsDaughter: 5 stars.Overall: 3 stars."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Soft chewy cookie with a thin layer of equally soft layer of fudge in the center.  The flavor is good but slightly salty.  Not sure if I would have noticed the salt at all if I wasn't reviewing the product.  Best to eat with a glass of milk.  The texture is somewhat uneven.  Every cookie seems to have one tiny piece where the texture is unexpectedly harder, although there aren't any nuts in the cookie.I was afraid that gooey would mean you'd need to wash chocolate off of your fingers after eating the cookie, but that's not the case unless you decided to play with your food.There are 2 cookies per serving with a total of 150 calories.  9 servings per bag.  I don't recommend having these shipped.  The package isn't designed to prevent the cookies from bouncing around during shipment and a number of cookies arrived broken.Overall not a bad cookie, but I doubt that I'll be buying them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Kudos to Nabisco for coming out with a new delicious cookie! Unlike the traditional Chips  cookie which is crunchy texture (and I'm not criticizing it, by the way), this one is chewy and has a fudge center in the middle in addition to the quintessential chocolate chips. My wife enjoyed it, too. We'll be looking for them at our supermarket (these went pretty quickly)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I enjoy the original <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9Z2BS"">Chips ! Real Chocolate Chip Cookies, 1.4-Ounce Single-Serve Bags (Pack of 48)</a> on occasion, but hadn't had their soft version for a while, and figured I'd give these new, gooey cookies a try, since they looked appetizing. How wrong I was. Opening the package I was confronted by a cookie massacre. About 65-70% of the package was a mess of broken cookies, displaced cookies, crumbled to pieces cookies, mashed cookies; not a pretty sight at all. I go ahead and eat one, a little mess isn't going to change the taste, right? First thought, ""Ugh, these aren't very good at all!"" As I chew, other thoughts race through my brain. Like, umm, where's the promised goo? All I have in the middle is a sweet, imitation-tasting chocolate (imagine my surprise when I saw they used real chocolate!), chewy-ish piece of food that bears next to no resemblance to real chocolate. The rest of the cookie tastes stale, preservative-laden, and a bit mushy, not my idea of a good cookie. Last, but not least, while cookies are purely junk food, the calories for these horrible cookies are 150 for two, which comes out to 75 calories for a rather small cookie (about 2 inches in diameter)! As I always say, ""If I'm going to put junk into my body, I want it to taste good."" These do not."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The bright, colorful package with the big picture of the chocolate chip cookie with ""chocofudge"" oozing out of the center creates great expectations. Upon opening the wrapper, you see very small, misshapen cookies. Some are crumbled because the package is way too large for the contents, and the cookies fall over and get jostled and broken.I see that one of these small cookies is 75 calories, so it really has to be good to warrant the count. No way!  They aren't chewy; they're mushy.  The flavor is weird, sort of sweet and chemical.  There is no clear chocolate flavor. Inside this small, thin cookie is a tiny solid dark mass; guess that is the ""gooey"" chocofudge. In sum, YUCK!These cookies besmirch the good name and reputation of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017Y9UKO"">Nabisco Chips !</a>. I have eaten and will gladly consume ""Chips !"" cookies, but these don't come close to the quality of ""Chips !"". One ""Chewy, Gooey Chips !"" cookie is too much. Save the calories and your money for better."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are quite tasty and it's a very interesting gimmick. As someone else pointed out, you do expect a little more ""goo"" since the package says ""Gooey"". The chocolate fudge inside is about the consistency of a slightly melted chocolate chip cookie. These cookies are also smaller than regular Chips ! cookies, and I believe you get less per package, but they're still an interesting treat if you're a fan of chocolate."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"It was pretty hard to judge the quality of the cookies because of the condition they arrived in: several were smashed into crumbs and none of them were oriented correctly in the container. They had that oily look that cookies acquire when they've been overheated. The packaging just doesn't seem well-suited to being shipped individually: the cookies have so much room to move inside the package that even with all the packaging Amazon fitted around it, they effectively self-destructed from the handling.That said, they were reasonably tasty soft cookies with an extra kick of chocolate in them. Nothing close to home made, but a decent alternative to other store-bought varieties.For comparison purposes, I picked up a pack of these from the local grocery store, and it was an entirely superior experience. Even the price was better than through Amazon."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"This is a nice new twist on Chips  cookies. These cookies are a much, much softer version of regular chocolate chip cookies, to the point where the packaging has a big ""gooey"" label on it. After having a few, I can definitely agree that these are exceptionally soft cookies, much softer than the regular ""soft"" Chips  cookies. However, it seems like a lot of the other reviewers have complained that these cookies aren't ""gooey"" enough. I definitely don't agree. For a mass-produced, mass-marketed Nabisco product shipped to thousands of stores, I imagine this is about as gooey as you can make a cookies and still have it last to market. It's not quite ""melting in your mouth,"" but it's not too far from that either. The flavor is also much richer than regular Chips  cookies. These have fudge in them, so there a much richer chocolate taste. Overall, if you like chocolate Chips  cookies, I suspect you'll love these. If you are picky about how ""gooey"" your cookie is, then store-bought just aren't ever going to be the same as homemade cookies in that respect."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies are not for the calorie counters but for those who want a tasty snack regardless of the consequences. Just reading the label, Chocofudge & Chewy Gooey, is a tipoff that you will move the scale pointer further after sampling these treats. There are 18 cookies about the size of a silver dollar in a resealable package designed to provide easy access. Each of these little cookies contains 75 calories of which 30 are fat. You will not be able to eat just one cookie. You will eat a handful of these cookies with impunity and when you finish you will shed tears of regret at you lack of disipline.Super market purchase is the best way to obtain these cookies because they are not sturdy enough to withstand the rigorous handling of shipping companies. I received one package from the Vine program and although it was well packaged none of the cookies were whole. By not having a whole cookie I was able to gather numerous pieces and pretend that I was eating just one cookie although in my heart of hearts I knew it was a bald-faced lie. I am now back on my diet and exercise regimen with shameful feelings of remorse but with secret memories of these tasty treats."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I like Chips  cookies, both the soft and the hard ones, and I like fudge, so that's two positives already. These chewy gooey cookies are the soft kind with a filling of fudge in the middle. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not find any plasticky or unpleasant taste with mine, nor did I find the cookies half crumbled when I got them.I didn't give these are 5 because after trying them I found that I'd rather have stand alone chocolate chip cookies and stand alone fudge rather than both together. And I thought the cookie itself was ok, but the fudge wasn't fudgy enough. But apart from that, I thought they were pretty good."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Chips  and I go back a long way. I remember plowing through whole packages of them on any given Saturday afternoon. They're not gourmet or anything, but the crunchy sweetness was just about right for an indulgent snack.Quite honestly, the gooey ""Chocofudge"" Chips  don't live up to the nostalgia.Opening the package, the cookies smell delightful, a heady mix of vanilla and chocolate scent wafting out immediately. The cookies stick together, coming out in bunches of two or three, slightly oily to the touch. They feel a little like raw cookie dough, but on the tongue they're somewhat mealy and too soft. The chocolate chips are runny and the chocolate filling is more pasty than gooey, about the consistency of Nutella.Flavor-wise, these taste about average for a store-bought cookie off the shelf. The chocolate and vanilla you smell when you open the package are both there, but a little too sweet to be appreciated. There's a hint of chemical aftertaste too, which lingers.Overall, this is an average cookie, and the current Amazon price is steep for an average product. Over $4.50 per package is just too much...I might go for $3.00 or $2.50 per package, but not more.And if I'm buying Chips  anyway, I'm still going to opt for the original, that crunchy goodness that reminds me of lazy weekend afternoons."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"This is definitely a downgrade from the standard chewy chocolate chip cookie.These cookies are supposed to be just like chewy chips  cookies filled with a ""gooey fudgey"" center.  There are three problems: first, the cookies appear a little burned when you open the pack.  Second, there are many more broken cookies than usual.  Finally, the center is not gooey, even at 80 degrees F.In fact, I microwaved a couple of cookies to see what I could do.  Even after just five seconds, the outside disintegrated, but the inside failed to get gooey.  I think there's just too little cookie and the center is too solid - it's about the consistency of the ""stuff"" in the middle of an oreo.Ok, so it can't all be bad, right?  Well, the cookie isn't even as good as regular ones because it's a bit burnt and greasy, and the fudgey bit in the middle is tasty but not really good enough.  The main issue is that the cookie isn't structurally sound enough to stay intact around that ""gooey fudgey"" center, and the middle part isn't better than the cookie it replaces.So I did what anyone would do and took them into work to get rid of them.  They lasted a shade under 4 hours on a floor of 30 people, and there were a lot of small pieces left behind.  I got comments ranging from ""that hit the spot"" through to ""even as free cookies go, I've had much better.""I won't be getting them again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These are soft and chocolaty, and I like them better than the crunchy chips , but they still have that store-bought taste.The packaging seems to be too big for the cookies, as a consequence they were a jumbled mess, I normally check the nutrition info and then divide by the members of the family to see how many each person gets, but so many of them were broken that it didn't end very well this time.I realize that contents are shrinking and the manufacturers are trying to make it LOOK like more, but I for one would prefer not to be treated like an imbecile who won't notice that the packaging would hold 50-75% more than is actually in there.Other than that, these are my favorite chips , since I prefer soft cookies, and while they can't hold a candle to home made, I'm not turning the oven on more than I have to in summer, so I'll be buying these again (and again) in the future."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm not a huge sweets fan, prefer chips and such normally, but every once in a while, like just about everyone, a sweet tooth bites me and I want something with some sugar in it.Having grown up in a family known for baking (grandmother used to make wedding cakes profesionally), cookies are nothing new.  And a good chocolate chip cookie can hit the spot sometimes, even for those of us who aren't THAT fond of chocolate.So the Chips  cookies here are a variation I haven't tried in their product line before.The cookie dough itself is about normal for them, not quite great but not bad, either.  A little squishier than I'd normally want, but these are supposed to be gooey after all, so that comes with the territory.And while the picture on the package shows something with just oodles of chocolate in the middle, while I think everyone knows it's a given that the picture is an exaggeration, I have to say it's not exaggerating by MUCH...  There's a LOT of chocolate in there compared to any other chocolate chip cookie.  For me, it was overwhelming, way too much chocolate.  My 7 year old said the same, took a bite, made a face, and threw the rest of it away.But these aren't being marketed to people who don't like chocolate, so our problem shouldn't be an issue with anyone that purchases these.Chocolate is pretty normal tasting mass produced cookie type of chocolate, with a pretty smooth consistency to it.  Again, nothing to rejoice about, but if you like a lot of chocolate in your chocolate chip cookiess, it will definitely float your boat.They're about the size of a silver dollar, give or take, so they're not very large, but given how sweet they are, I think anything larger would be overkill.If you like store bought prepackaged cookies, these should be just fine, if not a little better tasting than most of the other options."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Most people are on one side or the other when it comes to chocolate chip cookies - crispy or chewy.  When it comes to homemade chocolate chip cookies, I am definitely in the chewy camp.  So I was very excited to try this version of Chips .  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  As far as store bought cookies go, the regular Chips  are very good.  But the chewy just does not translate well to a store bought cookie.  It is more like a soft regular cookie, but not in a good way.  It is similar to stale Chips .  Sorry, but they were just not for me"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I eat very few sweets, and haven't had a Chips  cookie in many years. But I remember some good ones. I looked forward to sampling these. I tried one. First thing I noticed is how dry the cookie dough was. It is soft, but after a bite or two I reached for a drink. The dough was just dry, and what I was searching for was some flavor. There might have been some, but I may have imagined it. Next, the inside. It is a bit gooey, and consists of a thin layer of chocolate fudgey filling. Very thin. I was surprised again at how little flavor I detected. I expected a rush of sweet sensation, because as I stated I seldom eat sweets. Usually when I do eat something with a lot of sugar, I immediately notice it. Not so here. There was a little chocolate flavor, to be fair. But far less than I was expecting. And hoping for. These reminded me of standard issue packaged cookies.Kids will probably eat these readily, without complaint. I'm not sure that's a reliable method of evaluation. Or maybe someone who regularly eats cookies is in a better position to grade these. Problem is, I used to be one of those people. I still remember the many happy moments between me and my cookies. And some of them were Chips . But they weren't like these. I know if I am going to indulge in a cookie, I'll reach past these to whatever other options are available."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Ok, I haven't probably had a chips  cookie since I was a kid or close to it, so I thought I'd give these new chewy gooey chocolate ones a go.  Here are the likes:  They are soft and chewy and the middle is nice and fudgy.  Dislikes: small cookies-2 cookies are a serving size and 150 calories and these cookies are about the size of a silver dollar, the cookies though soft and fudgy on the inside are dry on the top, if they were just a bit softer and less dry they would remind me of how fresh out of the oven cookies get that nice melty center when you hit the chocolate chips.  So, for me, this cookie is not quite there.  I didn't dislike them, but I wouldn't run out and buy a bunch of them.  If they were less dry I might purchase in the future."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I saw the name ""Chips !"" and thought of delicious, crispy chocolate chippy goodness. Alas, these don't live up to the brand name.I rarely buy storebought cookies, honestly, so I really looked forward to trying these as a treat. Here's my three cents:1. The filling is not very noticeable except as a faintly chemical, chocolate-like slime. There wasn't much filling, either (and it does not, for the record, look at all like the package advertises when breaking the cookie in two). The last two days were quite warm and the cookies became almost liquid on contact with warm fingers. Quite a mess, especially with kids. In short, the gooey filling seems to me a gimmick.2. I do like these better than the other chocolate fudge flavour they have, but not by much.3. Despite not really caring for them, they WERE very addicting, and considering the calorie/fat content, this was hardly a good thing.If I want a tender cookie, I can make better ones myself from scratch. If I'm going to buy a chocolate chip cookie, I'll stick with the original crispy Chips ."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"If you want a chocolate chip cookie, this works, but it was too gooey and rich/sweet for my taste, plus a lot of calories for one cookie. But, since I didn't particularly care for the taste, one cookie was enough. So, I'd say the world doesn't need this cookie, but it's OK."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I'm sorry to say I will not be buying these cookies. Upon opening the re-closeable packaging, I discovered the cookies were tossed around in their compartments as well as being broken and crumbled. I tried two cookies as did my husband and 12yr old daughter; none of us were excited by them.I felt they had an odd taste - nothing at all like the regular Chips  and not the same taste as a homemade soft cookie. My husband who loves soft cookies also didn't care for them. My 12yo daughter liked the cookies but felt they were too small in size. The package has only 18 cookies meaning each only weighs a little over 1/2 ounce. I also feel they are overpriced - I will not pay nearly $5 for a small package of cookies - that's more expensive than Girl Scout cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are OK cookies. Nothing really stands out, however. They are very sweet, even for store bough mass-produced cookies. So sweet that it's unpleasant after a couple of cookies unless you have it in combination with something else (for me, tea). The texture is nice - soft and chewy - but it needs something to break up the softness. This is a cookie that just cries out for nuts to be added.The flavor is hard to pin down due to the heavy sweetness. There's somewhat of a poor aftertaste as well.But, the bottom line with judging the appeal of any cookie in my households is two-fold: are there any left over in the bag a short while after it's opened?; and do people want more after they are gone? The answer to both of those questions is no - while they were all snarfed up, there was no interest in getting more the next time at the grocery store. So, three stars. Not bad; not memorable either."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The chocolate filling inside is a little softer than the chocolate chips which is nice, but the flavor the the entire cookie tastes a bit like preservatives took a strong role in the ingredients. I flavor of the cookie is about the same as a regular Chips ! cookie. The cookie dough part is softer than standard Chips ! cookie making slightly better then the crumbly counterparts."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I really thought the combination would work well but found the fudge inside making the chocolate chip cookie a little to sweet.  I think I prefer them just the way they are.  Why mess with perfection?  They were always good so leave them that way.  I do enjoy cream filled cookies but dont think the chips  need them they were just fine.  Not like an oreo which needs them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are not bad but I expected more from Chips . The reason I love their regular cookies so much is because they are crunchy. These are not, they are very soft and chewy and that is not a texture I love in a cookie. While these cookies aren't crunchy, the chocofudge in the middle is a nice and added treat. It would be nice if the original crunchy cookies had this middle and then they would have a homerun on their hands. As it stands, these cookies are just okay."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"My kids really loved this cookie, perhaps because we don't buy many soft baked cookies. The cookies are moist and soft, with a layer of chocolate in the center. Since it was warm when they tried it, the chocolate (there's a lot of it) easily melted. My kids thought this cookie was great, lots of chocolate! I found them a bit grainy and lacking in texture, making them merely okay. Since I'm not used to soft baked cookies this might just be a personal preference. Overall, it's a cookie; of course it is good! Yet I wish it was just a bit better. Sill, if you enjoy chocolate you might enjoy this."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I thought these cookies were okay. They're actually much smaller than how they appear on the package, I expected them to be larger.  Their flavor is okay, but I wouldn't say they tasted great. The inside wasn't that gooey as they advertise on the package. I would grade this product as average."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"After receiving these today, I once again gathered the household testers together (aka, the missus and munchkins) to try these cookies.First, let me describe them. (The cookies, not the testers!  :-) )  They are about two inches across, maybe an eight of an inch thick, and are a darker brown than shown on the package.  Inside the cookie is a thin layer of fudge. The cookies have a bit of a dampish-texture and were all stuck together.The taste of the ""outside"" part of the cookie was slighly similar to soft-baked chocolate chip cookies.  However, the texture was a bit ""grainy"", somewhat like an soft oatmeal cookie.  The fudge layer on the inside was tasty, but was a little overpowered by the rest of the cookie.  It wasn't quite as firm as the layer you'd find in an oreo cookie, and was more like a spread.I love chocolate chip cookies, and I love fudge, so I had high hopes for these.  My wife has similar tastes and also thought they'd be a good cookie to try.  However, the testers and I unanimously agree that they are somewhat mediocre in taste and appearance.  While they aren't terrible by any means, they didn't grab me enough to make me want to go out and get more.  Everyone's taste is different, though, so you may love them.  I give these cookies a three star rating ... that is to say they're not good, they're not bad, they're only fair.As an aside, I received these cookies to evaluate as part of the Amazon Vine program.  The Amazon shipping container was very well protected and undamaged, but when I opened the pack of cookies, about a third of them had been reduced to crumbs, and only two thirds of them were in a condition to eat.  (And those were all stuck together.)  I don't know if that was due to rough handling or excessive heat during shipment, so I didn't consider it as part of my rating.  I only mention it as something to watch for in the event that it's a flaw in the cookie itself."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These Chocolate Chip cookies are so good. Chips  has made this cookie chewey and tastey. This in one of my favorite cookies...ever. They will be very difficult to keep in stock. They are yummy goodness."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"First let me say that I am big fan of regular crunchy Chips , and I esp. love the Chips  cookies with Heath bars in them, so I was excited to try these out.Although my cookies arrived more as bits of cookie in a bag, I wasn't upset because that can happen, and bits of cookies can taste every bit as good as whole cookies.Except in this case.  First, the cookies that were whole were quite a bit on the tiny side, and at a serving size of 2 cookies, you'll be getting 150 calories and 7 grams of fat.  That would be acceptable if these cookies were delectable.But they're not.  I didn't like them at all.  I thought they weren't very flavorful, and the chocolate fudge left a lot to be desired.  But worst all was the bitter, acrid aftertaste.I think Nabisco would do well to go back to the drawing board on these cookies, because what they have here is not working.  I'm sorry."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I like soft-baked chocolate chip cookies, and these Chips  Gooey cookies are very tasty.  If you can stop at eating just two, you'll end up with a moderate 15 grams of sugar in your system.If you keep eating, however, like I did, you may find these veer a little close to being candy.  The fudgy filling is pretty sweet and there is not a lot of cookie to  back it up.  I feel a little sick after eating five of them.Tasty, but a little too sweet for me."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These Chips  chewy gooey chocofudge cookies are extremely delicate and easily break apart if not removed carefully from the resealable bag. However, they are just so good, so chocolately, and so gooey soft without being gooey in the ""sticky sense"" of the word. There's also a thin layer of fudge in the center of each cookie.  Two small cookies will set you back about 150 calories with 60 calories from fat. There are about 18 cookies in a bag.Taste-wise they are great especially as a once-in-a-while treat for those who are more health concious.  I know they satisified my chocolate craving and were hard to stop eating once I started."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"We keep a constant stock of Chips  'original' cookies in out candy cabinet. We've tried all the variations that have come by, but we always end up returning to the 'original'. The Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are pretty much just their softer cookies, filled with fudge. I like the softer Chips  cookies, but never enough to repurchase them... I always considered them to be pretty 'boring'. These, however, with the perfect amount of fudge added are a LOT better. A vast improvement over the standard soft cookie. They also have an addicting 'crunch' from the chips (I like interesting textures in foods).I usually have 3-4 cookies with lunch, but with these I ended up downing 12 of them. That's when the bad news hit me. If you look at the nutritional information on the package, you would think that there is actually less calories and fat per serving, but then you notice that the serving size is two cookies, while the Originals have a serving size of three. The Original Chips  have about 53 calories and 2.7 grams of fat per cookie. The Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies have 75 calories and 3.5 grams of fat each! Wow, I realized I finished off my lunch with a 900-calorie 'snack'. I don't have any need to watch my weight, but after finding out how much they will 'cost' you, my wife won't even look at them.These are definitely very good cookies, but they still aren't a replacement for my Originals."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I typically don't like soft cookies. I prefer crisp, thin cookies. So, I was pleasantly surprised when I bit into Chips  Gooey Chocofudge. The chocolate chip distribution was excellent, (not sparse and stingy like other brands.) And the addition of the thin layer of fudge on the inside was a sweet, velvety experience. I ate one, then another, and then a whole row was gone. Needless to say, I won't be buying these cookies again because I can't trust myself to eat just one. :/ Fudge."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"At my house, I am known as the Cookie Monster.  I love cookies and bake cookies, too.  Chips ! (original) are one of my favorites.However, these are quite disappointing.  The packaging size and pictures are very misleading.  The cookies themselves are scarcely bigger than those ""toy"" cookies you get at McDonald's.  See my customer images.As far as chewy and gooey, I would call them more like soggy.  These arrived when the outside temps were about 90 degrees, so I expected them to be really gooey.  The ""fudge"" was a not-too-sweet and not-too-flavorful layer of filling in the middle which simply tears apart.  See my customer image.  They seem to be rather crumbly and mostly held together by their oiliness.Finally, a serving size is a laughable 2 cookies.  These are so tiny, I easily ate four of them which is two servings at 150 calories an 7 grams of fat each serving.  Overall, the taste is not bad, but it is not great either.  For a rather unsatisfying 300 calories and 22% of the USRDA of fat intake, I could definitely do better.I hope you found my review and customer images useful."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love cookies.  Let's be honest, I love all baked goods.  Chips ! has never disappointed.  Sure, some of their cookies are not not amazing, but they never made me go ""ugh!""  That is, until now.These are absolutely disgusting.  The ""soft"" cookies are almost more along the lines of mush and the filling doesn't taste like chocolate, rather, it leaves a gross plastic taste in your mouth.  I am incredibly surprised by this considering how fantastic these sounded and excited I was to try them.And at 75 calories for every cookie that is just slightly bigger than a half dollar, this isn't worth your while on a whole other level.Save your money, do NOT buy these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I would not buy these again.PROS:-Packaging: Open/reClose works well.-Flavor: Chocolate seems good.CONS:-Packaging: all cookies stuck together in stacks.-Flavor: No butter flavor, flour-flavor is noticeable.-Texture: Chewiness is a bit grainy."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The cookies are a chocolate lovers dream as they are filled with soft, ooey, gooey chocolatey goodness. For chocolate lovers you will love this cookie.Recommend."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies were the same shape and size as the regular crisp Chips ! cookies, but they were soft with a chocolate filling. The taste was almost exactly that of regular Chips !, which I really liked, but I have to admit the filling didn't really do it for me. I wanted it to be more dense and fudge-like, but instead it was really soft, like frosting, and took up too much of the cookie. The texture of the cookie was just a little too gooey in itself, I prefer something a little more grainy in a soft cookie.These weren't bad, but I guess I like the texture of a good cookie more than I like filling, so I would probably pass on these and get the standard Chips ! instead. I didn't hate them and I didn't love them. I can't see myself craving them.If you like frosting or soft filling in your baked goods, though, you might want to try these, because the taste was good and very reminiscent of a regular Chips ! cookie  I also liked the resealable package."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are so tasty! When I got them they were a little melted from shipping in the hot sun, so I put them in the fridge. When I pulled them out and ate them cold they were really great. I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that these cookies were enough to satisfy it. My only complaint is that I expected the fudge in the center of the cookies to be more liquidy because of the packaging which says 'chewy gooey' but they were still delicious and I would purchase them again. I received both this flavor and the megafudge. They were both great, but I prefer the chocofudge better."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Its hard to improve on a classic, but Chips  does it well. These cookies are scrumptious, i had to bring them into work before i ate them all. They are a little difficult to dunk in milk as they are so soft and not to absorbant, but it is doable.. Again very tasty and definatly a good buy!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I was not particularly impressed by these new fudge-filled chocolate chip cookies. I'm a chocolate-chip-cookie lover, but these just didn't hit the spot. There was almost no ""cookie"" left after they put in all the fudge. The dough that was left was a darker-than-normal brown, was crumbly, and seemed to be infused with the fudge. In all, they didn't taste much like chocolate chip cookies, though the fudge flavor is pretty good; and they were very rich. Also a warning, the cookies are quite small, but packed with saturated fat (4.5gms/18%dv in two cookies, though that's not that out of line with other chocolate chip cookies, either store-bought or home-made). So in all I'd say, not bad. But if you do go for them, go one at a time."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The resealable package is very nice, unlike their elvish competition.Upon first opening the package, the Chips  Chewy Gooey cookies didn't look that appealing compared to the photos on the package.  The cookies are soft, dark, and small, only about 2 inches across.  Because they are filled with chocolate, they can get crumbly and therefore might break apart during shipping.  Photo uploaded.  I think they could make the package smaller and contain these type of cookies better.They taste good but very rich, one or two at a time is enough for me.  Which is good because 2 of these cookies have 18% of your daily saturated fat allowance and 13g of sugar.  I would recommend these for an occasional chocolate cookie fix, but enjoy in moderation."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"If you like Chips  products, they don't disappoint with these cookies. They are truly sinful. The best way I can describe it... a chocolate kiss wrapped in a chocolate chip cookie. They are rich, but oh so good! If you like chocolate and you like chocolate chip cookies....it's a match made in heaven. Enjoy!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies have a really rich chocolate taste. Because of this intense taste of chocolate, one is best advised to not eat more than one or two at a time and have a beverage at hand (milk or cup of coffee if you prefer) to quickly wash away the powerful fudgey-chocolate flavor of the cookies. The cookies are soft in texture and are quite easy to chew. This is not a product I'd probably buy with my own money as I prefer the harder, crunchier, Chips , but if you're a fan of a soft cookie that packs a lot of flavor into a relatively compact cookie than the Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are worth taking a chance on."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Received a nice box of cookies ( total 18 cookies per box) packaged in plastic trays to help prevent breakage All cookies arrived intact and even in the brutal heat of Florida 92 deg. soft but not melted..Cookies were not crisp and filling was not gooey.. more like they had taken a  pat of chocolate and formed the cookie around it. If fact there was a slight crunch to the CHOCOLATE FILLING but not the cookie.  the cookie portion was very thin top and bottom with a few choc. chips scattered around.Now this is not a bad packaged cookie but certainly nothing to write home about. Just the regular  chips  cookie with a fudge patch in the middle. The over all taste is sweet and the usual fake chocolate flavors all store packaged cookies provide. This cookie has a rather odd aftertaste, as well.Again no kid would turn their nose up to these cookies but the average adult may take a pass.. Not worth the calories  = 2 cookies for 150 calories and 60 gm of fat.Not a repurchase for this house.. Sorry..."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These delightful little cookies are about 2 inches across, with tiny chocolate chips on top and a layer of chocolate fudge within.  The fudge layer is about 1/8 inch thick.  The cookies are soft and chewy and they are sweet, chocolaty and full of favor.  They are perfect with the morning cup of coffee.  They come in a handy easy-open and resealable bag with the cookies sitting in a plastic tray, which makes them easy to store and easily accessible, even to a child.  I will pick up a couple bags on my next grocery-shopping trip.  I like them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I've tried both the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2"">Megafudge</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U43ZO0"">Chocofudge</a> versions of these cookies, and I'm writing a similar review for both.Overall, I enjoyed the taste of these cookies.  The center chocolate fudge (which is soft enough to bite through easily, but not actually gooey) is quite tasty and the highlight of the cookie to me.  Chips  did a good job on that part.  The cakey portion of the cookies taste pretty good to me, too, but the texture isn't great.  They are kind of dry and just crumble apart.  So, not hard and crunchy, nor moist and soft.  More like dry and soft.  If you're like me, you're definitely going to want something to drink afterwards.I've tried the cookies at room temperature, warmed up in the microwave, and chilled in the refrigerator.  I like them chilled the best because the cookies didn't crumble apart in my mouth like they did otherwise.  Warmed up in the microwave, it wasn't much softer than room temperature...just harder to eat with some parts being uncomfortably hot.  Perhaps warmed in the oven would be better, but I haven't been inspired enough to heat up Chips  cookies in the oven, yet.  :)These things are bite sized and have 75 calories and 3.5g of fat each.  Not horrible for a cookie, for sure, but the taste isn't good enough to get me to pick these over something else.Given that the chocolate ""fudge"" is the main attraction to me, I liked the Megafudge version with the chocolate exterior better than the Chocofudge version because the chocolate flavor was much stronger.  Both are around 3.5 stars to me, but with the edge to Megafudge, I gave them a 4 and the Chocofudge a 3 here on Amazon.I'd definitely suggest getting a single bag at the local store to try these out before buying in bulk.  You might love these, but four bags is a whole lot of cookies if you don't.  ;)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:41 Mins</span>I do not buy too many pre-packaged cookies and when I do it's usually OREO's or fig newtons. This new cookie from Nabisco, the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge sounded promising and looked pretty good on the package but the reality was a little different.The cookie is very soft. Soft and crumbly in fact. It is so soft that it literally breaks in to little pieces as soon as I pick it up and begin to eat it. I guess that's a good reason to pop the entire cookie into the mouth in one bite, since they are small enough to do just that. The ""representation"" of the cookie on the package shows the cookie much larger than it really is and as you can see by my video, the real cookied bears little resemblance to the picture of the cookie.As for taste and mouth feel... I did not care for it at all.At best, this is a barely OK pre-packaged cookie. However I would not buy these again. I'm being generous with a 2-star rating. My wife took one bite and threw the rest of it away. The chocolately taste was the only reason I gave it more than two stars."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"When got this product, I was looking forward to a real taste treat.  A nice soft cookie with a gooey fudge center, what could go wrong?  When I tried these cookies, I have to say that I was far from impressed.When I received my package of cookies, it was a hot day and the package had been sitting outside for awhile.  I opened the pack of cookies right away and took a bite.  The fudge was gooey all right.  It might have been a decent cookie except for the fact the cookie part crumbled in my hand with the first bite.  This led to my hands getting covered in gooey fudge that made quite a mess.  All I can say is I am glad my 3 young kids didn't get into the cookies first.I left the cookies inside in the air conditioning for a few hours and decided to have one after dinner.  Much to my surprise, the fudge drastically changed texture.  It was no longer gooey, but now it was more of a spongy, solid texture.  There was still some ""gooeyness"" to them, but nothing like what it shows on the package.When it comes to taste, the only analogy I can think of is with chocolate.  You know those chocolates that come out on every holiday that people buy for the kids that is real cheap chocolate?  The chocolate is cheap, gritty, and kind of has an unnatural taste to it.  These cookies are kind of like that.  The cookie is not bad, but for some reason the taste just does not work.  The only thing that pops into my mind is that cheap chocolate.  The taste just does not seem right.  It did not taste like a decent chocolaty treat, they tasted artificial and cheap.  In my opinion, when the cookies were warm when I first tried them, they tasted better than when they were room temperature.  In the case of my family, these cookies got pushed to the back of the pantry and not even half a pack was eaten before they got tossed.I think the idea of product was great, but I think the execution was poor (kind of like the McDonald's McDLT for those who remember them, the sandwich where the hot side stayed hot, the cold side stayed cold, you put them together and you get a lukewarm sandwich).  The cookie was way too soft and crumbly, the fudge was not very gooey at room temperature, and the product did not have a good chocolaty flavor to it.  At the very least, a cookie that stayed together and did not make a mess would be a huge improvement.If you are a chocoholic, this product might be worth a try.  If you are looking for a sweet treat to savor the taste of, then I would definitely recommend steering clear of this cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"It is incredibly difficult for a huge company or even ANY company or even most bakeries to make a chocolate chip cookie that tastes homemade.  Apparently chocolate chip cookies are one of the hardest to duplicate.  While I did not expect this to taste like homemade,  I expected just a bit more out of this cookie especially with this flavor.  I love the regular chocolate chip cookies from this company so I thought I would love these also.This product certainly delivers what it claims with the fudge stuffed aspect. It is rich and fudgy, with a yummy creamy center and nice bits of chocolate pieces,  but the cookie surrounding the fudge is too chemical tasting for me.  If you  want the option of having a fudge stuffed cookie then stick to the  Megafudge style."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"When asked to try these, my daughter said ""delicious"".  Asked for more information she added that they are soft.  She would have expected cookies that come in this kind of package to be crunchy but these were surprisingly soft.  She also said they are very chocolaty, and when asked to give them a rating out of 5, she chose the 5.  So since they get the thumbs up approval of a teenage girl (not easy), I guess we'll be ordering them again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"When I think of chocolate chip cookies two brands come to mind, Toll House and Chips .  Now Chips  has been around for quite some time and over the years they have come out with many variations of their cookies, from the classic style to cookies with nuts, oatmeal, reduced fat and candy bits, just to list a few.This deviation is ""chewy gooey chocofudge"" which is a soft style cookie with a fudge center.  So to simplify even further, there is a soft/chewy chocolate chip cookie surrounding a fudgy center.  I would have thought I would have liked this cookie more than I did.  I mean a chocolate chip cookie with a fudge center, how could that be bad? Allow me to explain....I think that the combination of chewy cookie and fudge is too much.  I almost wished the cookie was traditional; it would balance the fudge better.  The fudge itself is almost more like cake icing, very concentrated.  Not to mention that all the fudge took away from the chocolate chips.  The final issue, perhaps the most unnerving, is there is a bizarre aftertaste.  It is almost like I can taste the preservatives in this product.  If a person is a hard core chocolate junkie I think this product is a grand slam.  I prefer the old school Chips  chocolate chip cookie. However, capitalism will tell if this ""spin"" on a classic will stay on the shelves or not.  Who knows, perhaps we will see chocolate covered chocolate chip cookies next."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These super moist chocolate chip cookies come with a layer of fudge inside of them. If you are looking for a lot of chocolate, these cookies are for you.But they are not as great as they are at first taste. After a couple of bites, the cookie part tastes a little bland, almost like they used too much flour in the cookie. When you bite into them, the cookie around the fudge stays semi firm but on the edges crumbles away. Also, they are really small cookies, about the size of a silver dollar. I was a little shocked at how few cookies were in the large package.And, of course, if you are looking for a quick chocolate treat, two cookies are 150 calories. If you want a good chocolate snack look elsewhere.Shawn KovacichCreator of numerous books and DVDs."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I am a big fan of chocolate and chocolate chip cookies, so I am somewhat partial to these gooey cookies. They are filled with chocolate fudge, which makes them noticeably sweeter than most other chocolate chip cookies. They are certainly very gooey, but they are not at all chewy. They are also much smaller than most other Chips ! chocolate chip cookies. They are very crumbly, and I am even tempted to leave them in the fridge to stiffen up. Like most other Chips ! packagings, the box has an easy resalable cover which will help keep the cookies fresh for as long as they last. Overall, these are good chocolate-chips cookies that add a new twist to this kind of sweets."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I wish I could give these cookies ten stars! I am not generally a fan of pre-packaged cookies, but these are as moist as homemade. The chocolate filling has the same flavor and consistancy as chocolate chips in cookies still warm from the oven. It is not gooey, nor is it overly sweet. And, there is exactly the right amount to enhance, rather than overpower, the taste of the cookie. Well done, Chips ! Very well done!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I can't give any higher recommendation than to say that when the mail came and this package of Chips  was opened in front of 2 adults and 2 children....the package was eaten in MINUTES!They were especially tasty when heated for 10 seconds in the microwave!  Gooey goodness!Would I buy them again?  Sure!  They were scrumptious.  However, if you want a package of cookies to LAST in the house...you best stick to something with a little less taste!Enjoy!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I was under the impression that everything that could possibly be done to a cookie has already been done. There have been cookies dipped in chocolate, covered in sprinkles, or with frosting on top. That is why I wanted to try these new cookies because I am always interested in a ""new"" take on the old classic chocolate chip cookie. Most ""new and improved"" cookies fail but Chips  has done it right this time!! These cookies are a wonderful new twist on the fantastic classic chocolate chip cookie. These cookies are just like regular Chips , which I love, but a bit gooey-er. They almost taste like they're just out of the oven. The best part, is that they have chocolate INSIDE the cookies. I don't want to say that they're ""stuffed"" because that would sound like the chocolate inside is overpowering...which it is not. Instead, there's a thin layer of chocolate in the middle that is just perfect and makes the cookies a real treat! If you warm them up a bit in the microwave or oven, the inside gets extra gooey and fudgey which I love! Basically, this is the perfect dessert. I felt completely satisfied after eating two cookies and with a good-sized helping in the package, I have more than enough for the next two weeks. I know that new takes on a tried and true classic can be a letdown, but trust me on this one...it won't disappoint!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"You are going to need it with these! Hopefully you will savor them, unlike myself. I ate the whole stinkin package!! Talk about yum. Chips  are delicious anyway, I was just craving them the other day, so these came at the perfect time. The fudge in the middle, holy guacamole!!! Just added another dimension to already yummy, soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies! Now I have to go soon and get another package, or TWO!!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies arrived on the first day of summer during a heatwave.  I expected they would be melted beyond all recognition and was quite surprised to open the package (which is cleverly resealable)  and find the entire contents intact.  Right away I wondered just how gooey and chewy they would be if 105 degree temps and a day in the mail truck couldn't melt them.Well, it turns out they were definitely chewy but not what I would call gooey!  I found these cookies to be pretty sweet, more so than ""chocolatey"" and that was a big disappointment.  I would have to say that regular old 'Toll House' type cookies are much better in both the chocolate and chewy category.  I also was struck by how 'processed' they seemed to taste.  More so than many of the packaged cookies we purchase. IN fact, for me there seemed to be some unidentifiable taste (not a bad taste) that didn't jibe with the ingredients.  Nothing terrible, just not what I was expecting.I admit my taste buds aren't what they used to be, but these are my honest observations.  I am quite sure these cookies will turn out to be many people's favorites so please don't take offense.  For me, I think I will stick with my standby toll house mix in a bag.  Yeah, you gotta bake em, but they are immeasurable better in every way!  Nice try Chips , but no cigar from this household."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I had actually had one or two of these cookies at a picnic a few weeks back. I was fairly impressed at how good they were and was eager to try them again.  Unfortunately, the pack that I received from Amazon was less than impressive. The cookies themselves were dark, seemingly burned. Half of the pack was broken. And honestly, they just didn't live up to my memory of just a few weeks earlier. I'd be willing to give the cookies one more swing, based on my first exposure.  Because, to be certain, if this pack of Chips  Gooey were my first go round...  there wouldn't be a second."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These are really tasty cookies, but the name isn't quite right. They say they're chewy and gooey. They're neither. The outside is more ""crumbly"" than ""chewy"", and the inside is definitely not gooey; It's more like a big chocolate chip.They might be gooey if you microwaved them for a few seconds, I suppose.They are so crumbly, in fact, that the contents of my package were pretty beat-up by the time I got it. Cookies were broken in half, or shattered into crumbs.Still, the flavor is awesome and that's what really counts here. I'd say get them if you're a chocolate lover."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"This cookies are simply delicious.  They are soft and chewy and will satisfy any sweet tooth.  The center has enough fudge to satisfy your taste buds, but doesn't overwhelm you. However, if you don't have a sweet tooth, you will need a cup of milk to go with this treat. My family loved them.  They can improve the resealable tab.  It didn't work well- at least on the package I received."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Not really impressed by these cookies. They are too sweet for me, and don't have much chocolate or fudge flavor. Also, they are more soft and gooey than chewy. Maybe they're OK as a kids desert, but I think adults will want something with more flavor."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Since it's summer and extremely hot outside, I expected these cookies to be very nearly melted when I opened the package.  But they were still perfectly intact.  And were not actually gooey at all.  The chocolate filling in them is soft and a little grainy as cooked chocolate tends to be.What I do love about these cookies is that the chocolate inside is dark chocolate.  In my experience, chocolate chip cookie fans like milk chocolate in their cookies.  I tend to prefer oatmeal and dark chocolate in my cookies--trick myself into feeling like it's a healthy cookie--but in most cookie crowds, my preference seems to be in the minority.  I am so glad the good people at Chips  see things the way I do.  Well, no oatmeal in there, but it is dark chocolate.They don't taste like fresh-baked cookies.  They are soft and moist, which is good, but they do taste packaged and preserved.  I guess that's not so shocking considering that they are actually packaged and preserved.  The cookies are small... I don't see a problem with that... as they are soft cookies; their size keeps them from crumbling under their own weight.I asked my 8-yr-old daughter to ""review"" these cookies.  I did use the word ""review.""  She said, ""They taste like cookies.  With extra chocolate.""  Then, feeling that a review should probably be more creative, she announced, ""It's like there are stars bursting in my mouth!!""  Yes, creative, but I have no idea what that is really supposed to mean.  Means she likes them I guess."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Chocolate chip cookies with a chocolate center? What a concept! Good thing someone finally made it real. Chewy Gooey Chocofudge is a treat which delivers what it promises, but not so much the ""gooey"" part.The texture of the cookie is like the soft <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E77LT6"">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Strawberry, 8-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a>, but that's where the similarities end. The chocolate center isn't gooey though, but it is a healthy dose of chocolate. Still disappointing for people who were expecting cascades of chocolate. I have a serious sweet tooth, and I found the aftertaste to be too sweet for me. They are still very enjoyable, just keep that milk within reach.Serious chocoholics will enjoy them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"What could be better than a soft Chips  cookie with a fudge center?  Apparently quite a few things, as this tempting snack did not live up to expectations.  To start with, the image of the cookie on the package looked nothing like the contents within.  Perhaps it was because the cookies arrived on my doorstep in the heat of summertime, I don't know, but what I found were trays of unappealing, blackened-looking (because of the fudge interior) chocolate chip cookies.  Oddly, it looked as if these snacks got into a fight and emerged all black and bruised.Still, a cookie might look ugly and still offer up a great taste.  Well, not so much.  Yes, there was a definite overload of chocolate, to be sure, but it had a sandy, gritty taste.  I stopped my snacking after a single cookie, even though the serving size is two for 3.5 grams of saturated fat (thankfully, no trans fat).  Again, I am willing to accept that I maybe got a bad package or one effected by the heat, though I rescued it from my porch less than ten minutes after it was dropped off by UPS.  I can't recommend this, unfortunately.  I would instead go with a Keebler Soft Batch cookie any day."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are pretty good for Chips  and have a good flavor.  The chocolate is a bit strong in the cookie (you feel that you need to drink something to overcome the flavor).  They are good, and enjoyable.  The Gooey center is not as gooey as the picture would have you think.  In fact I feel that they have a chippy (or hardened chocolate) when you bite into them.They are good, and if you give them a try you will either love them or hate them.  However, keep in mind, the different taste seems weird at first, but after a couple of cookies they are really good.In the end they are good cookies, and offer a different twist on the chips  that we all love.  Also they ship well.  I live in South Georgia and even after being in a mailbox for a whole day, they were not melted.  They held their shape and texture, and were very good (even after being in a mailbox in 100+ degrees weather!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"This is a pleasant new addition to the Chips ! brand.  It's softer and a little smaller than the original chocolate chip cookie. Each cookie has a bit of fudge flavored choco-cream in the center.  Although it's soft, it holds up surprisingly well when repeatedly dipped in milk.I scanned the package looking for any mention of hydrogenated oil, but happily found no such listing.10 oz was actually plenty to satisfy a couple of sweet-toothed kids (and mom).  It was a rare indulgence.  It certainly doesn't taste homemade, but will satisfy on a road trip any day..."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I received the package and was surprised that more than half of the cookies in the package were broken.  I ordered this as an office treat, and hardly anyone ate them.  They just looked said, all broken in there with no real chunks to grab and enjoy.These aren't that gooey, either.  I prefer the chewy Chips !, as at least they're intact.  These cookies tasted a little more dry than the chewy ones, and I didn't notice any larger chip chunks or ""gooiness,"" per se."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge along with their cousins, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2"">Chips ! Chewy Gooey Megafudge, 10-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> have been a disappointment. There is something off with the taste. It tastes flat and overprocessed, and on top of that each cookie is 75 calories. These are fairly small cookies, around 2 inches in diameter.Too bad because the description sounded promising. These Chocofudge actually taste slightly better than the Megafudge, perhaps because they have less of the uninspiring fudgeness.They arrive in a package that opens and reseals at the top. The cookies are arranged in three rows of six cookies each.They get 2.5 stars for the taste, but 75 calories for a 2-inch cookie drops them down to 2 stars.If I had to chose between these Chewy Gooey and the regular Chips  cookies, I would definitely go with the regular tried and true Chips s."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"My kids ate the whole package!  My ten year old says, ""They were good!  They reminded me of a melted Hershey bar."" She also would also recommend them to her friends, she says, because they were that good.  They were chewy and gooey and best chocolate chip cookies she says she ever had.I liked:  That they were divided into three stacks side ways.  There was 10 oz in the package, so it did seem there were less cookies than other packages.  However, the kids really loved these and there weren't any left over for anyone else to taste test by the time they were done snacking.  I think this would be a great snack for a chocoholic."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"This treat was tested by myself (mom/wife), my husband, and our 7 year old son. It is a very gooey chocolate chip cookie, with much chocolate goo on the inside.  I truly only like cookies that reach that certain perfect consistency when submerged in milk.  This cookie never reached that point. It stayed gooey and soft.  In fact, even when I tried to pick the cookies up from the container, then bent and broke apart.My husband commented that he enjoyed the cup of milk more than the cookies.Our 7 year old said that it was good, but he would choose the original Chips  over this gooey version.We all agreed that your money would be better spent, and taste buds more thoroughly satisfied, if you stick with the very delicious original Chips ."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love chocolate, and I love cookies, so I was excited to try these cookies.  I was particularly looking forward to a gooey center filled with fudge, as depicted by the large picture on the package.  I was disappointed.  There is a thin, disc-shaped chocolate-colored center in these cookies, but it is certainly not gooey.  Really, it's more like putty, and it doesn't have any discernable chocolate flavor.  The rest of the cookie is chalky in texture and also has no recognizable chocolate flavor.  Personally, I prefer the regular, old fashioned Chips  cookies over this new gooey version."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"If you've already committed yourself to eating some store bought cookies, these are probably the ones you want. They are soft and gooey. That, to me, pretty much defines a good chocolate chip cookie. The softer and gooier the better. Now, I don't even want to think about what chemicals they are using to create a cookie that stays soft and gooey for months. And I don't want to think about all that sugar either. Just give me my cookie and my big glass of milk. Chips , laddy!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"What I like about these cookies is how soft they are.  Most packaged cookies are hard, and you don't get that softness you get from a cookie right after you bake it.They are chock full of chocolate, but they are not as sweet as I feared they might be. I think most adults would want a better tasting chocolate for their palette, though, and a little less of that artificial sweetness.I think most kids would love them, and they are small, which makes for a nice treat size. They are not gooey when you break them open, though, as the picture on the packaging implies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"OK, these are my new favorite Chips  cookies! The usual nice taste, but with a surprise in the middle: chocolate gooey stuff! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge Chips  cookies are definitively chewy and there is is real gooey stuff inside! My kids' only complaint was that the package should hold more cookies! The resealable package is easy to open and reseals very well."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies taste fresh and sugary sweet, with `gooey' chocolate chips, and a `chewy,' but cake-like cookie dough texture.  There is a firm flavor of vanilla in these cookies, making for a nice contrast with the fudge flavor of the chocolate chips.  At 150 calories for two cookies, you'll want to pace yourself, or alternatively, buy lots of bags of these bad buys.  They taste great with a glass of milk as an afternoon snack.  They also taste great with a glass of milk as a morning snack.  As an evening snack..."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Chips !'s latest entry into the competitive chocolate chip market is ""Chewy Gooey Chocofudge"". The package comes with a convenient re-sealing top, to keep your cookies fresh. Which brings me to the cookies themselves - while they taste pretty good, they are definitely not what I clarify as ""gooey"". Think of these cookies as having a chocolate fudge inside, with the veneer of a regular chocolate chip cookie on the outside. The cookies are easy to bite into.Size-wise, the cookies are more bite-sized (3/4 of an inch or less) than regular size. They don't look as appealing as the outer package photo. If you can live with that, these are pretty decent cookies to snack on.My recommendation: put the cookies on a baking pan or microwave and heat them up before serving. They go well with a cold glass of milk, which is really the only way to eat chocolate chip cookies anyway."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I put these in my fridge for one day before I even opened it. When I did finally open it, contents had definitely shifted during shipping, since the inside of the package would lead one to believe it had been thrown down a flight of stairs. I know shipping is a separate issue -- unrelated to the quality of the product, but I would be hestitant to buy cookies online unless something were done about the packaging. Despite the cookies being busted, I enjoyed them being cold & hard, as opposed to being advertised as soft & gooey -- I think if these cookies were served room temprature, parents would have fun cleaning up chocolate covered kids. In any case, the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge is a yummy new item from Chips !!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I have never been much of a fan of Chips ! chocolate chip cookies.  I don't like hard chocolate chip cookies and I would only eat a Chips ! if I was stuck at a kid's party or some other place where there was nothing better.  Now, though, Chips ! has launched two new soft chocolate chip cookies:  the one under review here (Chocofudge) and Megafudge.  I think they are both pretty good, but I think the Chocofudge is better.  The Megafudge is almost like a brownie -- as many fudge-style cookies are -- and I prefer a more conventional cookie.  So, if you are thinking of trying one of these Chips ! cookies, you shouldn't be too disappointed with either one, but I would go with the Chocofudge.  Actually, of the mass produced chocolate chip cookies, I prefer the Pepperidge Farms soft baked Nantucket chocolate chip cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These were pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. The texture was good, as far as soft cookies go. They were soft, but still held together in the package and when you removed them from the package. The flavor was stronger and more chocolatey than the ""megafudge""  version of this cookie, which I also sampled. They were not gooey, in spite of the name of the cookie, but I see that as a benefit.The cookies come in the resealable package, which works very well and I like.I probably would not buy these cookies in the store, but did like them well enough to eat several for dessert on the day I opened up the package."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I absolutely adore chocolate chip cookies, especially soft ones with lots of opportunities to nibble.  These new Chips  cookies are so yummy!  They're soft, with lots of chocolate chips and a fun, fudgy center.  When I got a box, I immediately opened it and doled out portions for the family into separate plastic bags, because I knew I'd be tempted to each everyone else's share!  My share quickly disappeared, and I am now poised to go do a long, cardio-heavy workout to burn off all this sugar and fat.  As much as I love these cookies, they're NOT for every day, and especially not if you want to slim down!If you do purchase these through Amazon, I would recommend putting them in the fridge if they've been exposed to high temperatures, such as in the summer while they're out in the USPS delivery truck.  I can imagine the center fudge could easily melt and create a big mess.  Time in the fridge would solidify these right up.My only criticism would be with the price-- it seems a little high for only 18 cookies.  A family of four would go through a box in no time flat, for sure.But overall-- tastes great, don't have it every day, and be sure to burn off the calories!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I was disappointed by these cookies, and would never get them again.  Here's what went wrong.1. The cookies themselves are not ""engineered"" to withstand any kind of travel or transport.  Upon opening the package, over 60% of the cookies were broken, with piles of crumbs at the bottom of each tray well.  Those cookies that were spared would practically disintegrate when I picked them up.  This made for difficult eating.2. The cookies have a very strange chemical flavor to them that I couldn't explain.  it's most noticeable in the aftertaste, but both my wife and I found it extremely unappealing.  They're also far sweeter than normal chips ! cookies.3. The cookies are small.  Meaning, if you want to feel like you really satisfied your sweet tooth, you'll have to eat far more than the recommended serving size of ...two cookies (150 cal, 7g fat, 3.5 sat. fat, 13g sugar). If you can get past the aftertaste, you'll want at least 4 to feel satisfied."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are smaller than the average Chips  Chocolate Chip Cookie.  They are very soft and chewy, but not too chewy that your jaw tires before you can swallow!  I wouldn't say they're gooey, but they are ""mushier"" than a soft chocolate chip cookie.  They are VERY sweet.  Too sweet for me, and I am a major chocoholic with a sweet tooth!  They seem to have a lot of brown sugar in them as that's the most prominent taste.  The chocolate center isn't really fudgey either -- it's more like a Hershey's kiss in the center.  Kids will probably love these (my son likes them), but I'd never give them more than one or two in a day!  Honestly, I prefer the original Chips  over these and probably wouldn't reach for these again (unless my son asked me to buy them)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The cookie is basically a single ""center"" piece of chocolate with a thin cookie coating plus chocolate chips. The idea, is you heat them up and they become this big chocolate gooey-ness of delight.Well, yes and no.We get the same re-sealable packaging and 150 calories per serving (2 cookies. . .they are small)Also, I'm normally very critical about food products these days since we have the a lot of options to make things healthier. In this case we have flour, sugar, cornstarch, more sugar, cocoa button, etc. Overall, other than the preservatives that keep the cookies ""fresh"" I was impressed. . .but I still don't like them very much.I've always been of the opinion that processed/packaged cookies that say ""chewy"" never taste like real, soft cookies. And this continues that trend. . .it just doesn't taste real.I'm more of a processed cookie needs to be non-chewy or if you want chewy make homemade.Kids are definitely not particular, they just want a sweet item. My kids did like them, but agree that homemade cookies will always win out. Even with all their praise, they didn't come chase me down the following day for more cookies, they wanted other sweets. So, it was a fleeting impression on them too.Go with the original in my opinion, you could pass on these unless you really want something you don't have to cook and isn't a hard cookie cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies are great if you also love Chewy Chips  cookies. The extra heavy layer of fudge in the middle it too much for some, but for others in our family it was just right.That said; some of us feel that Chips  original cookies are the one and only. For us this cookie offers very little. They are not the cookie for those looking for that crisp crunchy perfectly balanced chocolate chip cookie that is the original Chips .Simple math: Love Chewy Chips  = Like or Love these cookies / Love original Chips  = Not likely to love these cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"While I love Chips  cookies, I can't say these ""Chewy Gooey Chocofudge"" cookies would ever win me over. They are slightly reminiscent of the Chewy Chips  cookies, but filled with fudge in the middle. If you like the chewy CA cookies, you'll like this. If you're on the fence about the chewy version (like me), then this definitely will not sway you to their side. Oh man, these are bad. I've tried eating a couple of them at different times of the day just to give my taste buds a chance to try a second opinion, but it's always pretty much the same. Think I'll go back to my old favorites, the original brand."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Small cookie with chocolate chips and gooey chocolate in the middle. It was soft and chewy which I like. Overall it was a little too sweet for me. As my teenager said after eating one ""eh"" Not bad, but not great,"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"First: I wanted to like these cookies.  I really did.  The concept is good, they look awesome on the outside of the package.  I like the regular chewy Chips  (like them, not love them) so I figured the addition of more chocolate would be a plus.Before opening the package, I checked the ingredients.  To my VERY pleasant surprise, no HFCS, but real sugar.  Doesn't say cane or beet, so I'll probably never know, but it isn't HFCS.  I'm sensitive to HFCS, so this was a BIG positive for me - and the only reason the cookies got two stars instead of one.Now for the bad:  The cookies are small.  A little smaller than standard crispy Chips .  That's not a bad thing, except a serving is two cookies and that serving comes to 150 calories.  For the calorie content of approximately 3 cookies, I could've had a Snickers bar (or similar) - and I would have been happier.Finally, to touch on the title of my review: I hope I got a bad batch.  These cookies were awful. They tasted like plastic.  I'm not talking about a plastic texture, but taste.  They honestly tasted like melting/burnt plastic.  My wife tried one and noticed the same thing (without any coaching from me).  I'd love to try another batch, in hopes of having received defective cookies, but I'm not going to take the chance.If you're considering buying a pre-packaged cookie, stick with the standard Chips  varieties - crispy or chewy.  But stay away from these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Words cannot describe the nasty aftertaste in my mouth right now after just having finished one of these cookies. I am currently wracking my brain thinking what I have in the house that might get rid of this taste (other than brushing my teeth). Ugh. Basically, these are the regular soft Chips  cookies with a chocolate filling. It's not a gooey filling that spreads out of the cookie when broken open like the picture on the package implies. The filling just sticks inside the cookie and stays there when you break it in half. Not gooey at all (though I'm not even sure that would have helped). The flavor is totally artificial and sickeningly sweet with, as I have already mentioned, a very nasty aftertaste that lingers. My husband had pretty much the same response as I did when he tried the cookies. My 12 yr. old kids are away for a few weeks, but when they get home I'm going to let them try them and see what they say. Personally, I would stay far, far away from these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The soft cookies are oddly flavorless, with a chemicalish undertone.  The filling is an OK texture (though not particularly gooey) and proportion, but not particularly tasty.  They weren't even very good dipped in milk.  I ate them, but I'm not sure why...I think it was just because they were there.  I wouldn't get them again, but a die-hard Chips  fan might like them alright."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"As a big fan of Chips  chocolate chip cookies, both the original and the chewy, I was prepared to love these as well. But it was just a big glob of mushy chocolate, barely held together with a tiny bit of cookie. Now, like most people, I'm pretty enthusiastic about chocolate, and theoretically, there is simply no such thing as ""too much."" But it just didn't taste right here. I really wish there had been more cookie involved, to break up the taste a bit; maybe that would've helped. But whatever went wrong here, it definitely did.Overall, it was a rather disappointing experience. I won't be buying these anytime soon."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I normally eat cookies from bakeries, rather than supermarket cookies, as  provided by my workplace at lunches and events, so I'm comparing them with what I'm familiar with, not against other industrially produced cookies.These are very sweet, without much real chocolate flavor.  While the gooey chocolate filling is much better than just the dry little chips, it needed to have more flavor. The texture of the cookie itself was what really lost me.  Instead of being soft and chewy, it had a sandy, gritty quality.  I'll stick with just the bakery cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Adding extra chocolate to something already chocolaty is usually a spectacular idea. Unfortunately, the end result of adding a gooey, fudge center to Chewy Chips ! cookies is something that looks like a mushy cookie and tastes like a mouthful of chemicals.The taste of these cookies is strange. They look and smell like your average Chewy Chips ! if left out in the sun for a bit. The appearance doesn't do anything to indicate the taste though. The initial bite is of a salty, sweet cookie, but there is a biting aftertaste that points to way too much in the way of processing and preservatives.The fudge used to fill these cookies isn't gooey. The picture on the package in no way accurately represents the consistency of the filling. The fudge is thicker and drier than expected and doesn't seem to have any flavor at all.Chocofudge Chips ! are a disappointment. A better choice would be to just stick with the original Chewy Chips ! cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"This rating is as much for the state of delivery as the cookies themselves.  The cookies were delivered in a box with air pillows but were totally crunched.  Because they are ""gooey,"" you'd think crunched meant just smooshed, but, no, actually crumbly as well. There wasn't a whole cookie in the package.Still, being a fan of the normal chewy Chips , I figured my cookie crumbs would at least be tasty.  The taste is different, though, more bitter and almost metallic.Maybe there was a chemical reaction going on here, exposure to higher humidity or air that caused the crumbs, thus impacting the taste, too.  Regardless, these were literally dead on arrival.I love amazon.com, but cookies and crackers seem to be total waste of money purchases.  I don't know if the fault rests with UPS, but cookies and crackers are the only amazon shipping fails I've experienced in 10 years."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge is very soft and chewy as advertised.  I found the chocolate filling inside a little overpowering though.  The cookie was smaller than the average chocolate chip cookie, but a little thicker.  I really liked the way the package opened and could be resealed.  It would be nice if all cookie packages were like this one.  I might have liked the cookies a little more if I could have warmed them, but the kids loved them and they disappeared too quickly for me to get the chance.  I prefer the Chips  chocolate chunk cookies, so my rating for these would be 3 stars, but the kids would rate them 5 stars.  I set my actual rating at 4 which is smack in the middle of what I thought and what the kids thought.  I think that's fair"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Basically, these are very soft chocolate chip cookie with a fudge filled center. This is pretty much what is advertised, and thus there can't be any complaints on that end. However, I just don't particularly see the value in this compared to many other options -- they don't particularly taste special (average....maybe even a bit worse than that compared to more expensive options), and each cookie is pretty small. Sure you can just eat more, but I find a single larger item more satisfying than two smaller ones, especially when it there's a filling such as in here. And the fudge somewhat overwhelms the fact they are chocolate chip cookies on the outside.Three stars, on account of the fact that they ARE still good enough that, were I presented with a plate of these and no worries about health, I would still chow down -- but at the same time, I'd choose many more options first were I given a choice."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"When Chips ! first came on the scene when I was young, I thought they were a good cookie that was always soft and a good balance of cookie to chocolate chip ratio. Since then, they have come up with variants on the initial blend to keep people interested and aware of the Chips ! brand line. Now they introduce Chips ! Chewey Gooey Chocofudge. Do I like it? Not really. Maybe its with age or refined taste or my lack of interest in snacks and sweet foods in my older years, but I found this cookie very sweet. Not just in the chocolate chips, but the cookie itself seemed very sugary. Also, in addition to the many chocolate chips, it looks like they baked one giant chip smack in the middle to ensure every bite gets a chocolaty taste. So it seems overkill on the sweetness factor. And because this is a cookie that is manufactured by food scientists to ensure sameness in every cookie, it ended up tasting on the artifical side. Perhaps these would taste better fresh out of an oven and have a warm taste, but that is a preference for the individul to determine. But they are not sold that way, so I am taking it as it is given. So will I buy these? No. I dont buy the ones I grew up with, so I definitely will not get these either."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Cookies are one of my four food groups, and it really pains me to give a cookie a bad rap. However, these cookies do not taste good! They smell sort of good, and they are fresh and soft. They taste awful! They do not taste like Chips  cookies or just plain old chocolate chip cookies. The soft ""chocolate"" filling has a very unpleasant artificial taste. The cookies do not taste like chocolate. They taste like a cheap, imitation food product. I had such high hopes : ("
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love the softness of Chops ! cookies so I like to buy them often, but I'm not all that fond of this particular Chewey Gooey kind. The inside is filled with gooey chocofudge, which I like as far as texture goes, but the chocofudge is really, really rich, too rich for my taste (had to break out the milk after one bite) so I can't have more than one cookie at a time.For intense chocolate lovers, this would be just the thing, but if you're not an addict of chocolate then this'll probably be a bit much for you."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"To say the actual product bears no resemblance to the gorgeous cookie on the package would be a huge understatement. The cookies are tiny and do not 'ooze chocolately goodness' as the picture indicates, although they do have something resembling a chocolate center. The cookies are tooth-achingly sweet and otherwise flavorless. The product looks interesting but the execution is very poor. I don't even have any suggestions for tweaks that would improve this -- Nabisco needs to throw this out and start over. I'm surprised it made it past what I'm sure must have been many testers and focus groups."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I am on a quest for a satisfying grocery store chocolate chip cookie. Unfortunately, Chips  Chewy Gooey didn't get me any closer to my goal. For context, I like regular Chips , but don't consider them great; I prefer a softer texture. Chewy Gooeys are not hard, but also not really soft. More mushy, or squishy. Also, the fudge filling isn't gooey, more like pasty. The overall mouth feel is too oily for my taste. Finally, I couldn't get the resealable package to open correctly and had to put the remaining cookies in another container.When I gave one to my husband telling him that I didn't care for it, he popped it in his mouth and disagreed with me saying, ""I don't know, they're OK."" We won't be buying any of these to stock our pantry.PS. A quick warm up in the microwave helped the texture of both the cookie and filling, but not enough to change my mind about future purchases."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are small, soft, cake-like cookies with a fudgey center. Yes, they're chewy and gooey and boy are they sweet. A bit too sweet for my taste, but my husband, who still has the taste buds of a kid, gives them two thumbs up. Pretty good for a store-bought cookie, and a little bit of an upgrade from regular Chips ."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are a chocolate chip cookie stuffed with soft chocolate.  They're good but they don't really take the basic chocolate chip cookie in significantly new or interesting directions.  This is nothing much more than a soft cookie with a layer of frosting on the inside. Ultimately not so exciting that they inspired much more than a shrug.  Not bad but really not a big deal.  And one of us who tried them said we'd rather just eat freshly baked cookies because these tasted a bit fake."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"It isn't really chewy or gooey but if chocofudge is concoction that is neither truly chocolate of fudge then the description is one third correct.  These cookies aren't as overly sweet as many new entries on the market but the smaller size does indicate that they are pushing the limits on how much sugar and fat can be stuffed into a single serving.  While the outside isn't as crumbly as the texture and taste would predict, it seems to be little more than a coating for the center portion of semisolid fudge.  This stuff is more sugar than anything else, with a bit of texture to it and a slight chocolate flavor.  The cookie itself isn't very good although there is only enough of it to cover the fudge center. Overall, none of the parts of these cookie come together well and the result is a letdown."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I ate way too many when they first arrived.  Like most chocolate chip cookies, I can't eat just one. For my personal taste they are way too rich & I probably won't buy them again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I like the regular Chips  cookies. They are crunchy. The outside of these Gooey gookies are crumbly like a dry cake. The inside is similar to the filling in a Keebler double stuffed fudge cookie, but the taste doesn't work well with the crummy cookie.Even a glass of cold milk couldn't save these cookies. I had another adult try one, but it went into the trash after one bite."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I couldn't resist getting a pack of these cookies to give them a try. As I opened the package the wonderful aroma of rich chocolaty cookies filled my nostrils. I picked up my first cookie and immediately noticed the soft texture and fresh feel. I was a little surprised when I gently broke open this chocolate chip cookie to expose the fudge center. The fudge center was not gooey like the picture on the packaging had suggested. The center was more like soft chocolate rather than gooey fudge. My wife decided to put one in the microwave in an attempt to make it gooey, yet that didn't work either.As for the taste, I felt the cookies tasted pretty good. I still prefer homemade chocolate chip cookies and I suppose I shouldn't expect packaged cookies to come close to homemade cookies. All in all these cookies are some of the better grocery store cookies you can buy. I recommend them, but I wish the fudge lived up to the advertising. Don't expect gooey fudge on the inside, but rather soft chocolate and you won't be disappointed.This item would get 4 stars if the fudge was actually gooey by the time it reaches consumers. I would be willing to give a perfect 5 stars if the fudge was gooey and the flavor profile tasted even more like homemade chocolate chip cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"(See the image gallery for my three photos that accompany this review)I hadn't eaten a Chips  in a while, but was kind of looking forward to these new ""Gooey"" chocolate chip cookies. But, from the moment I opened the package I knew I was going to be disappointed! First off, the cookies were a crumbled and jumbled heap of a few cookies in overly large packaging... the same as regular Chips  packaging that would hold two or three times as many cookies. Not the most appetizing first impression. So... is this really what Nabisco wants us to see when we open the package?? a jumble of cookies in an overly large package for the few cookies you get? A total turnoff from the beginning. I didn't expect the cookie to be as big as the photo on the package, but I did expect it to at least kind of look like the photo (which looks like a standard Chips  with the goo inside). This cookie was dark and mottled and misshapen and kind a gross to look at.Okay, presentation stinks, but maybe the cookies are really good nonetheless? Um... no... they kind of suck. And, Gooey?? Not even close... it is a wedge of grainy and dry chocolate-like stuff in the middle. The most distinct flavor (or really after-taste)? That is an overly sugary and heavily preserved food-like substance. After one cookie, I tossed the rest out.Bottom line... just plain gross."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These are chewy chips  cookies (not the crunchy ones), with a chocolate fudge baked into them. What could there possibly be not to like? ;-) The fudge is uniformly and well distributed throughout the cookie and it complements the cookie part well. The overall taste is very rich and very delicious. The soft chewy cookie complements the texture of the soft fudge very well. My only gripe is that the chocolate chips and the chocolate fudge create too many somewhat clashing textures. I think the cookie would be better if it had just the fudge inside the cookie without the chocolate chips."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The cookies are fine. A bit too sweet for my taste, but I really had to force myself to try one. Getting cookies shipped to you is NOT the way to go. Let's just say it was a cookie LOAF not individual cookies. Everything had melted together by the time they got to me in the mail. They were probably sitting in some mail truck for six hours re-baking. I don't think I can give a proper review for this one."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I must confess that I do not like Chips  cookies to begin with. Their recipe changed sometime in the past decade, and now they are just 100% pure nastiness. Adding a gross chocolate center makes them 125% nastiness. Seriously, I would not give these cookies to my worst enemy. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Chips  Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are delicious! They can be a bit messy in regards to getting chocolate on your fingers, but as far as flavor and texture goes for store-bought cookies, they're about as good as they can be. They're soft and moist. Each one is like a gooey, quarter-sized chocolate disk wrapped up in a soft chocolate chip cookie.They're not nutritious nor are they supposed to be. The easy open and seal package contains three stacks of a few [10 oz. worth of] cookies which probably will not last too long in a casual goodies-munching environment. A few seconds at a low-power setting in the microwave makes for a wonderfully fudgy melted treat."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Cookies were chewy with a fudge center, they didn't even last a day in my house.  Very yummy.  Reminds me of soft batch cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are really good tasting. The Gooey Chocolate is flavored just right to my taste.  Sweet but not overly sweet.  Some of the best cookies to come along in years."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The Chips ! Chewy Chocofudge cookies are just that. They are chewy with a gooey center of fudge, and taste delicious. They are really rich, and a perfect snack if you have the will power to eat only one or two. And, you better just eat one or two, or the package will be gone before you know it. Like all products, Nabisco is shrinking the amount of product they put in a package while still charging the same price.  You'll get around 21 cookies in a package (3 rows of 7)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These are soft chocolate chip cookies that also have a fudge filling.  Very good, although I slightly prefer the Megafudge version, as these are just a tiny bit sweeter than I prefer."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Because the box didnt fit in my mailbox it was dropped off at my door and as soon as i opened the package the cookies were in crumbles...but i wanted a cookie so i tried them anyways and they are yummy addictive...ooey gooey goodness thats great with a large glass of milk...enjoyashEdit:I'm not really sure why people thought that I didn't eat this product from Vine but when I recieved the product the cookies were in crumbles. Besides that I really did try them an share them with my kids who are the ones that said they were gooey. The cookies really are good an if your looking for something that has the chocolate chip original with a new spin these are for you. An now that the seasons are changing these would be great warmed up with a glass of milk...hope you enjoy them as much as my family am I did...:)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are very soft, chewable, and delicious!  The only problem I had with them is that each cookie is pretty tiny, so I kept eating them.  I don't know if they're quite ""gooey"" as the label claims, but they are quite good."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I did not find either the cookie part or the chocolate part of Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge appealing to my palate. There are only 18 cookies in this large package. If I feel a craving for a small expensive cookie with chocolate, I''ll stick with Pepperidge Farm or something from a local baker. This is not a knock on Nabisco, by the way; their Nilla wafers, Ginger Snaps, and Fig Newtons® are the supermarket cookies I buy most frequently; I've just never found their chocolate products (other than some Snackwells) very enticing. Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge did not change that."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"First, let me say I'm an adult, so maybe that affects my tastes.  On the other hand, though, I have not one but 32 sweet teeth.  With that being said, I'm going to be bold and assert that the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are going to be too sweet for anyone over the age of 11.  Unless you're drinking really black coffee with them.  The kind of black coffee that is so dark and strong, you wouldn't be able to see ANY light through it if it were in a clear cup. Besides that, if you're looking at these cookies here on Amazon with intent to order a bunch, you should note that they don't travel well.  My package arrived looking like most of the cookies went through a rock tumbler (on the bright side, I guess they're ready to be made into a cookie-crumb crust?).  They ARE chewy.  Gooey?  I wouldn't go that far.  Maybe on a really hot day, or if you put some on a plate and microwaved a few seconds.  Finally, they have sort of a Play-Doh aftertaste if Play-Doh were made with lots and lots of sugar.  Chips  has a good thing going with their original cookies.  I think these are an abomination and should be skipped right over with no regrets."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These are definitely below average cookies.  They don't even try to look homemade, and are kind of small and processed-looking.  For taste, they are passable but I thought there was something powdery and definitely salty about them.  In my little tasting party of seven people in my immediate family  I was hearing words like  chalky, boring, stale, and ""has that low-fat taste without the low-fat benefit.""  They are certainly edible--but it's not a product I would seek out."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The package of the cookies shows a VERY gooey cookie but the cookies fell well short of that. I liked the soft texture and there was a lot of chocolate even though not it wasn't quite gooey. I wouldn't seek this cookie out especially but I would eat them if someone served them to me. Chips  has plenty of delicious cookies that I would eat first."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I usually like Chips , so was eager to try these; they were, unfortunately, a disappointment.  To start, the portion size is incredibly small: two mini cookies equal 150 calories.  And there was just something artificial about the taste.  The chocolate was only okay and the surrounding cookie was fairly blah.  They are, however, chewy so at least that part of the description is accurate."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Anyone who has eaten a real chocolate chip cookie would not bite twice at a Chips  Chewy Gooey Chocofudge creation.  The chocolate center makes up the largest part of this small cookie and while it is soft, it is not what I would call gooey. It does taste pretty much like semi-sweet chocolate which is about all this product has going for it. The pastry part is chewy in a dry sort of way with a strange taste going down and a bitter, unpleasant back bite afterwards.  The 2 piece serving has 150 empty, off-flavored calories that could be wasted on something far tastier.  The lift resealable packaging must be less expensive than the original. It may or may not be effective but it is hard to imagine that a stale chocofudge would be any worse than a fresh one."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge tastes a lot like chocolate with the cookie ""breading"" of a Fig Newton.  I doesn't taste a lot like the original Chips !  It was soft, with a log of chocolate (though not particularly soft or gooey chocolate).  Personally, as someone who likes Chips ! and who's not a fan of Fig Newtons, it was not a tasty cookie.  If a chocolate Newton sounds good to you, then you'd probably enjoy these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm not usually a fan of chips , but these changed my mind! These cookies are tasty! Chocolate stuffed and chewy! I foresee myself taking trips to the market and sneaking these home!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Anyone who loves chocolate would like these cookies.They're chewy, gooey and delicious!Thanks Amazon for letting us try them.We like them too much."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I was very interested in what Chips ! would do with a soft cookie and these do not disappoint. Like most soft cookies, they use a lot of brown sugar (or at least it tastes like brown sugar) in the flavoring to keep them soft. As I understand it, there is a variation in taste bud which causes some people to taste this type of flavor as very bitter and objectionable - luckily I'm not in that group but if you have had that experience with soft cookies this might not be a great purchase for you. The chocolate flavor is very bittersweet, which I like as well. For me, the resealable package is a blessing and a curse - it works so well that I find myself returning for more and more cookies whereas a more challenging-to-open container might serve to slow down my vacuum-like consumption.All in all, this is a recommended product for those that like soft cookies with bittersweet chocolate. I actually prefer the original Chips !, however."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies seemed a little on the small side, but they're chock full of soft, melted chocolate - not too sweet (especially with a strong, black cup of coffee) but satisfying enough to the sweet tooth within the serving size (2 cookies). I like to microwave my cookies to soften them up and make the chips melt, but this wasn't necessary with these Chips  Gooey (no, they weren't particularly gooey but I was glad - the chocolate was melted but not messy - perfect). Very soft cookies that amazingly did not crumble."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I always liked Chips  cookies and was glad to try this new variety where cookies are still thin looking and yet loaded with chocolate.  They were delivered on a sunny Florida day and cookies braved the heat until I come home from work.  They probably spent at least five hours in the hot weather, in the mailbox.  When I opened them so I can treat myself to a desert after dinner, they were still intact.  Bag comes in resealable package, so one does not have to worry abot keeping cookies fresh.  Cookies were medium size and loaded with chocolate both on the inside and outside.  I liked cookies very much and I took them with me to work, so I can nibble on them when I feel like having a desert after lunch; or in a late afternoon with my last cup of coffee."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These Chips  Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are very similar to Keebler Soft Batch Cookies.  They are about the same size and softness.  I am not sure if Soft Batch has the fudge center these do, which in my opinion, give them the advantage.  They are small, about 2"" each, and come about 18 to a 10oz package. Stats are not great but not unexpected for cookies: 2 cookies 150 cal, 7g fat, 3.5 sat. fat, 13g sugar.  They are tasty little guys and my whole family liked them.  I recommend the Megafudge version if you like all chocolate cookies.  Those were tastier but you really have to like chocolate (like I do)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love chocolate chip cookies.  I love Chips ! chocolate chip cookies.  So, CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies should be just about perfect, right?WRONG!!!  CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies truly could not be more disgusting.  The cookie is mushy not chewy, the taste is like cardboard, and the chocolate fudge smells and tastes medicinal.  They are not at all sweet.  They are tiny, highly caloric, and have a strong, weird aftertaste.I've offered samples of CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies to just about everyone who has entered my house in the past few days, just to see if it was me or if it was really the cookies.  It really IS the cookies.  My family (husband and kids ages 6 and 14) were not impressed.  Friends and neighbors were equally disappointed.  The best thing my kids said about CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies was that they tasted like Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars.  Now, that may very well be, but I ask you:  who wants their chocolate chip cookies to taste like dry, low cal cereal bars?  Not me, that's for sure!It is possible that the packaging and shipment may have contributed to the disastrous taste and texture of these CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies.  These cookies were shipped to me, cross country in 100 degree weather.  They sat in my broiling mailbox for most of the afternoon.  But, come on, if you are going to offer a product that you ship nationwide or worldwide, then it needs to be able to  stand up to any and all possible conditions.  Hey, Nabisco, you need to seriously rethink this product.  NOT RECOMMENDED."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"If you're a Chips ! fan, you'll probably understand when I say these taste like the red bag <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OXIZOE"">Chips  Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</a>, not the regular blue-bag <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9Z2BS"">Chips !</a>. They're a slight bit sweeter, a lot softer, and the cookie part doesn't have that (to me at least) distinctive Chips ! flavor. It's like they took a Chewy Chips ! cookie and shoved a large chocolate fudge chip in the middle (which I guess really is what they did).They don't taste bad - far from it. If you're a fan of Chips ! cookies in general you won't be disappointed. They're addictive and will hit your sweet spot sugar craving without much effort. To me they were a bit on the over sweet side of the fence which was probably the only thing that kept me from eating the whole bag at once. Kids?  Kids will probably inhale these.It should be noted that even at room temperature (78-80 degrees) these things are falling-apart soft and the chips are melty. On the day they arrived, they were literally destroyed (and it was a cool day - only reaching 94 instead of 104). You opened up the package and it was just a giant clump of cookies and chocolate. Attempting to pull out a single cookie resulted in ""cookie bits"". After a while in the AC they did firm up a bit and had their shape somewhat restored. However I would call these cookies overly-soft.Oddly enough, the ingredient list was a lot easier to understand than I would have guessed. There aren't a ton of artificial ingredients (comparatively to other snacks on the market) - I'm not saying these are an organic, all-natural wonder, but other than a few specific additives, you could probably make these at home from scratch.IngredientsUnbleached Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate {Vitamin B1}, Riboflavin {Vitamin B2}, Folic Acid), Sugar, Semisweet Chocolate Chips (Sugar, Chocolate, Cocoa Butter, Dextrose, Soy Lecithin), Palm Oil, Invert Sugar, Coconut Oil, Dextrose, Soybean Oil, Cocoa (Natural and Processed with Alkali), Cornstarch, Whey (from Milk), Leavening (Baking Soda and/or Ammonium Phosphate), Salt, Molasses, Nonfat Milk Solids, Caramel Color, Soy Lecithin, Natural and Artificial Flavor.Serving Size: 2 cookiesServings Per Container: 9Calories 150  Calories from Fat 60Amount Per Serving and/or % Daily Value*Total Fat 7 g (11%)  Saturated Fat 3.5 g (18%)  Polyunsaturated Fat 1 g  Monounsaturated Fat 2 g  Trans Fat 0 gCholesterol 0 mg (0%)Sodium 110 mg (5%)Potassium 60 mg (2%)Total Carbohydrate 21 g (7%)  Dietary Fiber &lt;1 g (3%)  Sugars 13 gProtein 1 gVitamin A 0%Vitamin C 0%Calcium 0%Iron 4%"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"There is only one word for ""Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge"": Yummy!I open a pack of 4, and all of them are gone in no time. The pack was shared by one adult and four kids, everyone loves it.The pack of 4 actually contains more than 4 pieces: it has probably 12 regular cookie size pieces. Sorry, I cannot get an accurate count of the number becausee they are all gone before I can count them. Enjoy it!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These are good, but the chocolate gooeyness is still somewhat subtle.  I had expected more intense.  These cookies are actually better when they're a little bit beaten up in the package.  For whatever reason, the crumbliness makes the flavor stand out more.  (A weird thing I discovered between my first and second box of these)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I can't review these cookies completely honestly: my family ate them all before I even got home on the day they arrived. On the other hand, that's a pretty strong recommendation, don't you think?By all accounts -- there were three greedy family members (not including me!) who got to eat these fudgy, chewy cookies -- they were entirely satisfying and quite tasty, and I have to believe them.But I don't think I'll ever have cookies sent by mail to an insecure location again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I thought this Chips  Chewy Gooey ""Chocofudge"" product was pretty darn good. I prefer this one over the other Chewy Gooey flavor ""MegaFudge"" because it has a better balance of fudge and cookie. The Megafudge tasted too much like a hot cocoa flavor on the outside dough instead of a traditional cookie dough flavor. That's why I say that I prefer this one. Other than that, the two flavors are very similar.  A few other minor complaints is that the dough on the cookie crumbles a bit easily... especially around the edges. I would've liked it more cohesive. Also, the ""fudge"" core wasn't quite creamy enough, as far as the texture is concerned. The fudge also would've been better if it tasted more like ""dark chocolate"", but instead it tastes more like hot cocoa. Despite these observations, I think these are pretty delicious cookies and definitely worth a try. If you like the chewy variety of chocolate chip cookies, I would definitely recommend these for you to try out."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The kids loved them, I loved them and they were definitely gooey. Warmed up in the oven they were the best. Soft, not crispy, with chocolate oozing out of the middle. Excellent and a tasty treat. Taking it one step further I also put ice cream between two of these cookies, stuck it i the freezer or 20 mins and it came out to be the best ice cream sandwich. Chip  is definitely missing out on a potential gold mine in the ice cream sandwich department."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"This is a Chips  flavor called ""Ooey Gooey Chocofudge,"" so it should already be pretty clear from the get-go who is going to love this and who isn't.  The cookies are soft, but don't fall apart or dissolve in your mouth.  They are definitely gooey, but not overly messy.Obviously they aren't going to beat homemade fudge cookies fresh out of the oven, but for a packaged treat in the goodie aisle of the supermarket, these are pretty tasty and well worth the purchase.  Add a little milk and you're in for a seriously good time."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I am a fan of Chips . I love them. I am not, however, a fan of the Chewy Chips . Those are too soft. the flavor is very different. I like the original and even the low-fat. Yummy.So i was a bit skeptical about the Chewy Gooey Chips . but Nabisco nailed it: they found a great balance between gooeyness, chocoloateyness, and cookieness. Magic, if you will. These are yummy cookies, not too sweet, not to soft. Delicious. Sorry, I have to go... I'll get myself another cookie...."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These sounded like such a great idea.  Of course gooey chewy chocolate fudge cookies will be wonderful, right ?  Sadly, no.  There is a strong artificial chemical taste and the texture is neither chewy nor gooey but only soggy.  They were surprisingly edible after having been left to get stale for a month.  I would never buy them at a grocery store."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"My kids absolutely loved these cookies, which have a chocolate filling that is sort of like commercial chocolate frosting. I thought they were good (they are Chips , after all!) but I prefer the original Chips  or Chunky Chips . It's a fun and different cookie but for everyday cookies, I think I will stick to the original types."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I've always loved Chips  cookies, so I was excited to try the new Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge......In retrospect, the operative word is ""Chocofudge"" which conjures up images of something that is not quite a food, more like a chemically created psuedo-edible.....thing. The fudge in the middle of the crumbly, dry cookie is neither chewy OR gooey, more like a piece of old jerky that's been sitting in a hot car for a few days. I cannot imagine ever having any occasion to eat one of these cookies again......."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The Chips ! Chewey Gooey Chocofudge cookies are good for a packaged cookie. They were soft like homemade cookies but the taste was off and tasted like a typical packaged cookie. They were fudgy and full of chips, but to me they did not taste homemade. Overall they are good for a packaged cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I like these better than the Chips  Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  There's still a slight aftetaste to these cookies, though.  Yes, the cookies are soft, but they really aren't as ""gooey"" as the name implies.  The packaging, with its resealeable flap, is a good idea.  It will keep the cookies fresher longer.  If you like Chips  cookies, you will likely enjoy these too.  For me, they were just okay."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These were a little too gooey for me. Parents should have napkins readily available for young children as there may be quite a mess, especially if it was hot weather. Also, having been through the shipping system, many of the cookies were broken. Of course if you can find these in the store, you probably won't have this issue. One thing you could do is refrigerate them and then you will have a nice soft cookie that doesn't seem to melt on your finders. My recommendation is to purchase these in winter months only."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Yuck.That's the one word I would use to describe the taste of these.But, before we get to taste, let's talk about how these were so smooshed and crumbled inside the package when I opened it. Many of them stuck together, and then fell apart when you tried to pull them apart. They're WAY too mushy and soft, so much so that they lose their form and come apart into pieces.The taste, to me, was awful. I can't even describe it, but let's just say that my reaction was ""Ugh!! Yuck!!"" after a few chews. It almost had a medicinal taste to it (to me, anyway). I also found that they leave a bit of an after taste in my mouth. I LOVE cookies, baked goods, and almost all sweets, but I couldn't tolerate these. I ended up throwing most of them out because I didn't want to eat them.Good try, Chips , but not your best work."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"This is the first cookie I've ever eaten which *almost* had too much chocolate in it -- but not quite!I got these in the mail and had a pal with me at the time -- we're both trying to count calories a little but this was a bad time to do it. So I had him open the package and I said we'd just try a couple apiece. We arrived at my house in about 20 minutes and they were all gone. Diet blown but, man, those were good cookies. Somewhat chewy and very rich.Highly recommended if you're splurging."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"My family and I loved these cookies a little bit too much. I think they only lasted 24 hours in my house with a family of 5 that is not good. They tasted yummy. I liked the gooey middle. They are Chips  goodness with a bit of an extra bit of goodness."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Fudge flavored chocolate chips? Soft cookie? Sounds good, huh?Well, it's on OK cookie, not a great one. The ""soft"" style of cookie just doesn't have the taste of the harder original style and the fudge chip tends to overpower the cookie as well. In fact, I am more fond of the original Chips  than these.That being said, I ate the whole package because, let's face it - an OK cookie is better than no cookie at all."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"It did have a fudge center but it was too much chocolate and not enough cookie,  and the cookie was all damp and soft as a consequence.  I think gooey is the perfect word - but it translates to soft and not very interesting,  as well as having a bad chocolate cookie ratio.  Too much of a good thing can overwhelm the flavors, and unbalance the baked good...We all ate 2 (some may have eaten 3) but we all agreed that the while regular chocolate chip chips  are terrific,  these are not.  I will not buy them again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These are all right.  I probably liked chips ! cookies more as a child than I do now.  They taste fake, look kind of gross and just aren't very good overall.  The chewy fudge in the middle is pretty lacking, but it does make the cookies softer than your normal chips ! cookie.  They are slightly better warmed up, but I can't say I'd recommend them.  There are so many better cookies out there worth buying.  Not to even get into the ingredient list, which contains nothing decent for you.  I'll pass."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These should be amazing.  Really, just look at that picture!  A chocolate chip cookie that is chewy on the outside and full of creamy fudge.  Good glory, I could go into a happy coma just thinking about it.Unfortunately, they are not so good.  The fudgey middle is actually just a bigger chocolate chip, and the cookie is more crumbly and dry than chewy.  The taste is heavily dominated by all of that chocolate, and the chocolate, while not bad, is not good enough to stand on its own.Don't break your heart by buying these.  Just look at the picture and dream."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I tried this cookie at the same time I tried Chips  Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  These cookies are better than Chips  Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies, but they still fall short of what I expect from Chips  Chewy cookies.I have given up expecting products to look like their packages.  I suppose there is a bit of artistic license in making food look as though your mom and grandmother whipped it out of a bunch of basic ingredients.  The problem, of course, is that the cookies bear little resemblance to the picture on the package.  Things seem to go downhill from there.Try putting one of these cookies on a napkin next to the package.  The picture on the package is beautiful, with chocolate chips on the outside and gooey chocolate in the middle.  I could barely see the chocolate chips on the cookie itself because something, crumbs I think, covered the chocolate chips.  None of my cookies were lovely and round like the one of the package.  Instead, my cookies were mostly broken and I had a difficult time removing more than fragments from the package.Well, beauty is only chip deep, I suppose.  The important features are the taste and the texture.The texture was okay.  The cookie seemed chewy and moist to me.  In general, I thought the texture of these cookies compared favorably with regular Chips  Chewy cookies.The taste was okay.  The taste was hardly great, but okay.  I tasted cookie dough and then a chocolate hit, about what I expected for chewy chocolate chip cookies.  What I missed was the creamy chocolate in the center of the cookie.  I tried several of these cookies, trying to taste the creamy chocolate in the middle.  My taste buds could not separate the taste of the supposedly creamy chocolate from the other flavors in the cookie.These cookies need to compete with regular Chips  Chewy cookies along with dozens of other varieties.  In order to do that, a new cookie should be phenomenally good to convince customers to change brands.  However, this cookie is hardly phenomenally good.  In my opinion, this cookie is just average.  I believe there are many better options available, particularly given the price of these cookies.  My prediction is that either this variety will disappear from store shelves or its formula will change.  Meanwhile, you have plenty of other, better choices.Good luck!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These are okay cookies, and they keep well, but the chocolate taste is a little overwhelming for me. I'm not sure if there's some bitterness there, too. Anyway, each cookie is a nice small size."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are billed as soft-baked cookies with a fudge center.  The cookie part is pretty good - definitely chewy if that's your thing.  However, the fudge center has a strange, almost bitter taste that is at odds with the rest of the cookie.  It also has a thick, gooey (can't say they didn't warn us) consistency that makes each cookie way too rich and heavy.  Even though the cookies are small, you'd be hard-pressed to eat two of them because of the heaviness and strange flavor combination.  Make sure you've got plenty of milk on hand when you bust these ones open.Also be aware that due to the small size of the cookies themselves, there was a lot of shifting during transit.  As a result, several of the cookies were already bent if not bashed into mush by the time the shipment arrived.If it sounds like the Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies were saddled with a name that only a kid would love, it's likely no coincidence.  Only a kid would (probably) enjoy the cookies as well.  Anyone who puts much/any thought into their snacking would steer clear."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies were certainly chocolatey, what with the gooey chocolate-flavored filling.  But, it was kind of a phony-tasting chocolate flavor, as opposed to the rich milk chocolate flavor of, say, Nestle Toll House morsels.  Furthermore, there was also a someone stale, wheat flour flavor that lingered on the palate after the chocolate flavor faded.  Plus, these cookies were somewhat soggy, not in the least little bit crunchy.  Neither my wife or I cared for them much, to be honest, and won't buy them again.  Kids might like 'em, but they didn't impress us in the least..."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"We all can see that these are mass produced processed cookies destined to sit on grocery store shelves and occasionally find their way into one's basket and eventually tummy.  In that context, these are good enough, but they fair to excite or live up to the promises implied in the packaging.  That being said, you can do far worse in the cookie aisle, and these may do the trick for you, just don't expect more than these can offer."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Nothing will ever beat the taste of a fresh warm homemade cookie. Chips  Chewy Gooey Chocofudge will help you satisfy your sweet tooth even if it isn't homemade. My husband loved these and ate the whole package (except for the two I managed to get!) They're soft (which I like) and the fudge inside replicates the gooey-ness of a cookie warm from the oven. Now this isn't to say that they taste like the ""real thing"" because they don't. But when you need a chocolate cookie fix, this will do!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love chocolate chip cookies. I love fudge. So, when you combine the two, one could reasonably think that it would make for a perfect cookie right? Well, it very well may, but in this instance it doesn't.A couple things for starters.Based on the packaging and picture on the packaging I was expecting to bite into this cookie and have fudge ooze out. Not the case here. The fudge, and I use that term loosely, if really just a gob of something in the middle that does no oozing at all. I even tried to microwave a couple cookies to get the packaging effect and never did.The cookies also seem really dry and crumbly. I usually like the Chips  line because of the soft chewy nature of their cookies but these are just a crumbly mess.Just a side note the cookies in the package I received looked nothing like the cookies on the packaging. Several were reduced to crumbs, a couple were slightly burned, but none even resembled the picture on the package.Taste wise they were average at best. Nothing special about them, which left me disappointed. I was expecting a more full flavor and something different than the normal Chips  chocolate chip cookie. Didn't get that. If I see these at the store I will most likely skip these as they aren't anything special."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are moist and have a good chocolate taste. They are a chocolate chip cookie with fudge cream in the middle. They were really good after I warmed them in the microwave for about 12 seconds!The package has the pull flap on top that reseals. And it worked well. They didn't get stale after 4 days.I will buy this product."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I should have known when I selected these packaged treats what they would taste like--overprocessed, high sugar, high calorie discs of nothingness. To compare these to real home baked cookies is like comparing real life to THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY. There may be something to occupy your time for a moment or two, but there's no substance, and certainly no love, underneath the veneer."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"This cookie is very similar to the Chewy Chips  except it has added chocolate chips on the outside.  It tastes okay but it's not going to earn raves.  Just like the Megafudge version, the cookies are very small and at 150 calories per serving (which is only a few cookies), it's not worth it. The taste isn't spectacular, cookie kind of dry, although the fudge center tasted good. It's a small package as well (10 oz) and at more than $3, I think I can find a better tasting and more satisfying cookie at my local grocer."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love most things chocolate and these were quite tasty, although rather thin, with a soft center of chocolate.  My husband, the real cookie connoisseur, told me he prefers the original Chips  because they're crispier. So let that be your guide; if you're a fan of gooey centers, these are for you; if you're a fan of crispy, stick with the original."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies, while they don't look like the one being broken on the package (maybe if heated?), have great taste, and stay chewy even if refrigerated.  I found them delicious and tried to hide the box from myself in order to try to make them last longer than a day (I was successful ... barely).  They are definitely a big step-up from standard chips  (which I would rate as ""OK"")."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"....  but neither my husband nor I liked them.  After opening them (and trying a single cookie each), the package sat untouched for almost a month before my youngest son decided to try them.  He liked them enough to eat more than one, but even my boy hasn't finished the package after more than a week (very unusual for him).My husband prefers the crunch of original Chips ! cookies, and while I usually like my cookies chewy, I didn't like these.  Maybe if they had put the fudge center in their original cookies (instead of inside soft cookies), these might have more fans at my house."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Growing up in San Francisco, home of Mrs. Fields's cookies, I have a very healthy appreciation of soft cookies.  Couple this with the fact that many packaged cookies that you find at the super-market is pretty stiff and crumbly, I'm generally apprehensive when I hear about the words ""gooey"" and ""soft"" when describing such cookies.  Regular Chips  is no exception, unfortunately.  I do, however, appreciate their chunky chocolate cookies (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VMW1QA"">Chips ! Chunky Chocolate Chunk cookies, 13-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>), especially the peanut butter ones (don't see them on amazon, though).  Therefore, when I saw the new Chewy Gooey line of cookies, I had hope that this new generation of cookies would continue their improving trend!Sure enough, the cookies were soft.  I wouldn't say that the chocolate was able to stretch like on the main package, but there's definitely more chocolate in these new cookies than in your standard Chips .  It's almost like a filling lay, and definitely not just chips being melted more during the baking process.  Honestly, they're strictly not even chocolate chips anymore, more like a fudge.And the big question, are they tasty?  Definitely.  Are they messier?  Yeah, so be even more careful giving them to little kids (or even my 10 year old, who happens to still eat with her hands when we aren't looking).Recommended.  If only they'd bump up the package size closer to the 12-14 ounce of the earlier packages (or even better, make them 16 ounces again!!!!!)  Then I'd give them 5 stars!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I'm a chocolate fan, and a cookie fan, and I like the idea of these cookies. The thing is, it turns out I just really don't like Chips . If you do, but wish they had more chocolate, you'll probably like these.I don't eat many packaged cookies, but I was still surprised at how little I liked these. Honestly, they kind of taste like cardboard and chemicals. The chocolate is, of course, low quality as well, but that's to be expected.Lest I sound like an irrelevant snob, I will say that I do enjoy Oreos, and they're certainly made of cardboard and chemicals -- they just don't taste like it. But it would be hard for the local cookie man to recreate an Oreo, whereas he can do super chocolatey chocolate chip cookies no problem, so....if you want the latter, just go buy fresh made. Unless you really do like the regular Chips , in which case these are even ""better"".(I'm gonna get blasted for this, aren't I?)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"What's better than a chocolate chip cookie filled with fudge?  A WARM chocolate chip cookie filled with fudge!  I pop one of these cookies in the microwave for a few seconds (experiment to find your perfect temperature), then sit back with a warm cookie and a cool glass of milk.  Pure bliss!  Granted there are plenty of calories in this treat, so do consume in moderation.  It is a wonderfully decadent treat!Service size - 2 cookies, 150 calores, 7g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 110mg sodium, 60mg potassium, 21g carbohydrate (13g sugar, less than 1g fiber), 1g protein.Contains: wheat, milk, soy."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Yes, these Chips  cookies are better than their hard, crunchy counterpart, but they still taste very artificial. Also they are not terribly gooey, just very soft, with the chocolate in the middle seperating very easily. I've had worse and obviously much, much better, but I think some kids would like them regardless. I brought these into work and left them on the counter. They were all gone by lunchtime so I guess some adults who could care less about quality would like them too."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The downfall of these cookies are not the way they taste, but the way they are advertised. From the packaging, I expected a chewy cookie with a soft and, to use Nabisco's word, ""gooey"" chocolate center. Unfortunately, the cookies failed to meet my expectations.The actual cookie part was similar to what I expected. The outer portion tastes just like the normal chewy Chips ! cookies. However, I would not describe the center as gooey. Instead the chocolate center was closer to the consistency of chocolate that is just beginning to melt.While I would not say these cookies were necessarily bad, I certainly would not pick them over regular chewy Chips !"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I couldn't wait to try these Chips  cookies. I mean, how do you make chocolate chip cookies better -- by putting more chocolate inside (yes, I'm a chocoholic).  The chocolate has a strange taste to it.  I definitely prefer the plain, soft batch chocolate chip cookies by Chips .  However, they weren't so bad that I didn't finish the entire package!!!!!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I could't finish the first cookie I tried. It just tasted overly processed and chemical-laced. Ick. But I am giving the cookies two stars since my husband ate most of the package before I threw it away. When asked, he didn't really like them but he didn't find them as repulsive as I did, obviously. He didn't complain when I threw the rest away however. I wouldn't buy these even on sale and in desperation for a cookie. I can handle a regular Chips  or Keebler at times but these were just gross to me from appearance to consistency to taste which was the ultimate condemnation."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Not a bad cookie. It is a tad dry, but the moist fudgey interior makes up for it. It has a rich taste of chocolate  and the interior is smooth and tasty. A nice cookie, especially nuked in the microwave for a few seconds or with a cold glass of milk."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These Chips  cookies are not very appealing nor appetizing.  When we first opened up the package, we noticed the majority of the cookies were broken or in crumbles.  One of them even looked like it had a bite taken out of it.  You can't always judge a cookie by its appearance, so we tried a few.  The exterior is soft and the fudge inside isn't bad.  But it just didn't mesh well together and it won't be a cookie you crave.The other negative is that each cookie is fairly small and contains 75 calories, which is pretty high considering the size.  You can get other chocolate desserts that will bring you more satisfaction at lower calories."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies were chewy and gooey as promised. They even included a good amount of chocolate making the Chocofudge moniker appropriate. The product itself I have no problem with. The cookies were delicious and are definitely something I would buy again and recommend to my friends, but the way they arrived? Smashed to bits! If I were to buy these cookies I'd save myself the hassle of eating crumbs and pick up a package at the grocery store.Maybe they were all crumbled because they're chewy cookies? I doubt it. I buy chewy cookies at the grocery store and have never seen so many smashed up cookies in one package. Maybe the UPS guy threw my package around because it was relatively light? I'm going to say that's doubtful because everything else I've received via UPS or from Amazon has arrived in tip-top perfect shape. (Including soft cookies from Mrs. Fields.)The Chips ! package just isn't made to endure the rigors of shipping in anything other than it's nice large case of cookies that arrives at the grocery store and then gets parceled out and placed on the shelf. The packaging wasn't sturdy enough to keep the cookies in place despite a plastic tray with individual slots for each cookie. In the entire package I had approximately four whole cookies. The rest were pieces. But at least they were delicious pieces!Like I said earlier, I'd definitely buy these cookies again but it'll be from my local grocery store, not from Amazon."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I'm not a huge packaged cookie eater, but I like regular Chips , so I thought I'd give these a shot.  I found them somewhat pleasant, but a bit unsettling.For starters, the cookies came with a resealable package.  That's cool and all, but my package had been opened, presumably by the workers who shipped the cookies, and a cookie or two eaten from each row!  A few of the remaining cookies were broken, and the majority were covered in black chocolate smears.  This was not the best presentation, and although I wouldn't expect packages to be open normally, the crumbs and smears I would expect are common.Taste was okay, close to a classic (non chewy) chips : not too sweet and somewhat cracker-like.The texture was a bit too crumbly, but similar to regular chips .  The gooey insides were not as gross as I expected.  More of a drier chocolate pudding.Ingredients were better than expected.  There's still a lot of sugar, but no hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup. That's nice to see in a mass market product like this.Overall I found the cookies okay, but unimpressive.  Buy a single box before you go for the box of 4."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Chips ! is a mass-production outfit, so there's always going to be something a bit industrial about the cookies they turn out. These are definitely very edible and, if not exactly addictive, I could (and did) find myself putting away more of them than I should at one sitting. I didn't think these ""Chocofudge"" cookies were as good as the all-chocolate ""Megafudge"" variety, but still, the quality of the chocolate was, again, industrial at best. My wife, who knows her chocolate, said it tasted like they were trying to craft something darker than milk chocolate without the characteristic bitterness of true dark chocolate. She didn't think they succeeded. But if you're not looking for a connoisseur cookie experience and just need something for the snackin', these might not be bad to keep in the cabinet. If they make it there before you eat them all."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"What can I say?  I love Chips  and this one with a nice fudgy filling was just what the doctor ordered.  I'm a chocoholic and proud of it!  The cookies are nice and soft with just the right amount of choco chips that are enough to satisfy even the pickiest of chocolate lovers.  Ahhhhh, these with a nice cup of ice coffee, YUMM!I do so like the softer cookies better I think even though if you are going to be dunking you might want the hard ones.  They are great with ice cream also.  I softened up some good chocolate ice cream and crumbled up pieces of these cookies and mixed together then refroze and oh my it made a nice sundae for the terrible heat we've been having.  You have got to try a few as I'm  sure you'll be hooked in no time."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"We really liked these cookies!  While we were expecting them to be hard and crispy like the regular Chips  cookies, these were actually soft and chewy, just like a home baked cookie.  With the addition of the chocolate, gooey center, these cookies exceeded our expectations and will definitely be something we purchase again in the future.  These cookies will satisfy your sweet tooth and go great in milk.  Try some and you'll see that I'm right!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Basically these are Chips  chocolate chip cookies with a fudge center. When I first got them they were very gooey, as it was over 100 degrees that day. I put them in the fridge and that fixed that. But after trying them hot and gooey, room temperature and some-what gooey and cold and not-gooey from the fridge, I have to say, I liked the cold from the fridge ones the best.Overall though, the original Chips  chocolate chip cookies taste far better to me and the gooey factor just tasted gross. I'll stick with the Original from now on."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are chocolate deliciousness.  The title of Gooey might be a bit much and they don't really live up to the image.  The center has more chocolate (but not gooey and not like the photo).  If you chill these cookies there is really next to no gooey coming out of the center.  The flavor of these is really nice and they are soft!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I can understand the mixed reviews for these cookies.  The taste is what it is but that just means some folks will like them and some won't. I thought they were fine. I wouldn't buy them again mainly because I try to avoid eating cookies, but I didn't sense any chemical or plastic character as some reviewers mentioned.  Each cookie contains an abundance of gooey chocolate fudge that is definitely very sweet. The dough itself is also sweet and I thought it had a good texture to it. Not too crumbly, but soft and chewable.  I like these much better than the regular Chips  cookies which to me do taste artificial. The only drawback - each cookie has 70 calories and they are not very big. On the plus side, even one cookie gives you an overload of chocolate and sugar so I can see why such a small thing is so caloric.I would recommend just buying them for yourself and tasting them.  What is ""too sweet"" for some is ""just right"" for others. I found them to be very chocolately and sweet."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Chips ! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge are normal size cookies with a chocolate chip type dough with a fudge type layer within.  The dough itself is good and the fudge is tasty.  Although I enjoy these cookies I think that I like Chips  chocolate chip cookies better."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"It's been a long time since I've purchased this sort of cookie, and I was surprised by how sweet they are.It's overpowering.  It doesn't even taste like chocolate.  I just get SWEET SWEET SWEET in my mouth, and there isn't any other data getting to my brain.  After I eat the cookie, the aftertaste is actually a bit noxious.I also requested a different flavor from this brand, and surprisingly, they taste great.  These simply don't.  I love chocolate chip cookies, but perhaps I'm spoiled because I bake a lot.  These are simply too processed and sweet for me.  And I'm no snob.  I love cheap junk food.They are chewy, and they are filled with some kind of super sweet frosting, but it's just too darn sweet.  Makes my teeth hurt just thinking about it.  Also, when I cleaned out my desk I discovered one of these cookies had fallen out of my lunch bag a few weeks before.  It probably spent five weeks in the open air, and yet it was identical to a fresh cookie from the original package.  No bugs had touched it.  It hadn't dried out.  Whatever they are using to preserve this product is potent.I realize prospective customers for this product are not looking for Martha Stewart's $100 chef inspired perfect cookie, but they probably want something that is reasonably wholesome and tastes less like chemicals and corn syrup."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"You know those soft chips  cookies that you so love? These are not those.These are smaller than those, stuffed with some plasticy-tasting 'fudge' that's actually pretty solid. Maybe like a brick of fudge but less yummy?It's 4 points plus for 2 cookies if you're doing Weight Watchers and TOTALLY not worth it.They also turn rock hard within a week and a half so chow down fast. Or just throw them out. That's probably a better option.Again, Ew."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"It's ok- kids and young people will like it, but older people or those not into supersweet chemistry will find it too much. It's soft, chewy, and the one good thing is, after two cookies, you will want to share it because you won't be able to eat more!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I received a package of both these and the Chewy Gooey Megafudge... so I will compare both of them.  These are excellent cookies for a store bought cookie. They are soft and have a great flavor.  Although I'm more of a brownie person (and thus loved the other variety), my husband is an avid chocolate chip lover and greatly preferred this version.  Lots of chocolate inside makes it an awesome cookie... no more plain cookie if you happen to be low on chips in each bite. EACH bit is guaranteed chocolate since it has a nice chocolate center. But it's not overbearing at all, it's really done quite nicely.  My only complaint is really towards store cookies in general: they all have a tendency to have that store bought chemical taste (I think it's the preservatives). Nothing quite like homemade in that regard!  So I took off a star for that. SOME expensive brands somehow mange this by having quick expiration dates, and if you want to spend the money on those it's worth it!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Well, I can tell you, these didn't last long after I brought them to work.  Anything chocolate, of course, elicits immediate interest, but there were two of us working in the area when I opened the bag and a scant 3 hours later I discovered that only about 6 cookies remained. The fudgy center is certainly an added bonus to an already good cookie. The consistancy is good; not too soft, not too brittle - and overall flavor is excellent also. This would be another thumbs up."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Homemade cookies are the best in life, so I won't attempt to compare this to them.For a store-bought cookie, they are decent. I liked the MegaFudge better.They are soft and have a fudge ""ribbon"" in the middle that improves after having been microwaved. They do have that store-bought cookie after-taste, but they are a good cookie for an emergency treat or dessert on vacation.I feel like they could have included more in the package. The package seems disproportional to the amount of cookies you actually get. Also, they are quite fattening. The calorie and fat content is high per serving, but it is a cookie afterall.I may or may not get these again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"There must be a common ingredient that all ""chewy"" cookie makers use because they all taste the same. Be it Soft Chews, Chips  Chewy, or even Pepperidge Farm, whatever it is that keeps these cookies chewy also keeps them palpably homogeneous.  Chips  Gooey are no different.  Even the ""fudge"" on the inside tastes like ""that flavor"". Now don't get me wrong, ""that flavor"" is good and put me in the right mood, it's positively addicting.  Just know that's exactly what you're getting into here and don't expect a chocolate chip symphony in your mouth."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies were good for a packaged cookie. Of course, with three kids, cookies of any sort are not long in the house. Here's the breakdown:1. Crumbled cookies: I didn't have the problems with crumbled cookies that other reviewers had. They held together nicely. However, getting baked goods shipped to you always has a risk, especially during times of temperature extremes like summer. So, that might be a problem in some cases.2. Taste: these cookies are no comparison to a homemade cookie, but what packaged cookie is? The taste is about the same as a regular Chips  Cookie if you added chocolate frosting to it. They do taste like a commercially processed food. Most likely because they are.The chocolate filling adds an additional flavor to the normal Chips  taste. It's good, but not super exciting.3. Gooey-ness: The picture and label hints that you're looking at a fudgy-gooey center. The package I had was good, but the chocolate was more a disc of chocolate. It was not hard, but it wasn't the runny-chewy that it looks like.4. Overall: these cookies weren't bad, but they also aren't something extremely exciting.These are ok if you want to keep a package of cookies laying around."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"My 7 year old liked this cookie, but  she couldn't handle eating any more than 1 a day because it was overly sweet.Personally, I didn't care for the taste that was full of preservatives and was the furthest thing to the standard home or stored baked cookies. It's interesting that they were able to keep the chocolate soft inside the cookie, but it didn't add any value to the cookie. The cookie was indded soft, crumbly, w/ lots of chocolate inside but the overall taste was just too unnatural to enjoy.It's not something I'd recommend."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"To me, despite the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge hype, these tasted pretty much like any other packaged soft chocolate chip cookie that I've had.  They are small enough that it just takes one bite to eat one.  It's very soft and so is the chocolate fudge in the middle and the chocolate chips.  They tended to already be broken or crumble pretty easily.  The chocolate is very sweet with little cocoa taste and the cookie itself is also very sweet.  You definitely need a glass of milk to go with these.Overall, it's a pretty basic packaged cookie experience - no surprises or anything special.  My kids of course liked them the most.  I don't think the package lasted more than half a day in our house."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I saw these in the store and wanted to try them because they looked like something so chocolatey and delicious. I couldn't wait to bite into one and have the chocolate just ooze out of it. Unfortunately, when I tried it there was no oozing or chocolate explosion or really any sort of different flavor from the soft chewy Chips !So, I thought to myself, aha! If I warm them up in the microwave they'll get the texture and oozyness that I'm looking for. Again, big disappointment. It was just a warm cookie.I'd have to say that these are really no different then the chewy Chips ! There may be a slightly more chocolate filling flavor but not like what you'd expect from something that claims it's gooey. The cookie certainly doesn't look like the image on the cover. Even after the microwave it still pulled apart without any goozing of any sort.They're good cookies and all just not what I expected or hoped for."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"My husband and I love chocolate chip cookies.  We enjoy especially ones that are warm and gooey.  So when I saw these we just had to try them - they are great.  I often make the refrigerated cookies and we eat them while they are still warm.  These cookies taste like they are fresh from the oven; pop them in the microwave for 20 seconds - warm cookies from the oven.  The package kept them fresh even after being opened for a about a week.  An added bonus the fudgy center."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"take Chewy Chips , add some EL Fudge to the center, and this is the beautiful baby you get. while i'm not sure 'gooey' is the right word for the fudge in the middle, i am sure that tasty is the right word to describe this cookie.the fudge in the center adds a little extra chocolaty flavor without ruining the texture and deliciousness of the cookie. so good."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"To begin with, I opened the package and found about 20% of the cookies had already crumbled into pieces.  That's how fragile these cookies are.  With homemade cookies, I've always preferred the soft and chewy ones, but these go beyond soft.  I found the taste of the cookie itself to be only okay, and the fudge filling wasn't what I would call gooey.  I tried eating these at room temperature, warmed in the microwave, and cold from the fridge, and there are still plenty of store-bought cookies I would prefer over these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are okay for grocery store cookies made with preservatives.  They aren't as good as Nestle Tollhouse or Mrs. Fields but they're better than the unrecognizable brands one might buy at a gas station.  The ""gooey"" filling is surrounded by a chocolate ""shell"" within the cookie and makes for contrasting textures - soft cookie, chocolate shell and gooey center.  While these are in the Chips  line, they are quite different from the original.  Not better or worse.  Just different."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I like ginger a lot, but these cookies are very, very strong. I really wasn't expecting the flavor to overpower the cup of tea (lemon ginger). I rather thought it would complement well."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Ginger snaps have a special place for me, one of my top 3 cookies (peanut butter cookies done right are number one, then giner snaps or molasses).  When I had the chance to get these from Amazon Vine program I had to try them.  These are some very good ginger snaps, the ginger flavor is nice and strong for those who enjoy a gingery flavor without to much for a casual eater.  These are outstanding with a nice tea."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"This review will be rather short, since there's not a lot to say. Overall, cookies are good. Being organic is a huge bonus!  After having several people try them, including my son who absolutely loves ginger, the conclusion was ""too much ginger."" It's potent.So if you love ginger, definitely give these a try. But don't expect it to be as mild as your typical ginger snaps."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"This is one of the best cookies. My kids loved them too. they are really flavorful and not so hard my teeth couldnt get through them. Really good cookies i would get again"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love that there are more and more organic options out there, and Paul and Nell Newman is a brand I trust.I eagerly anticipated the cookies, but for me they were too sweet.  I'd not be fair to let me be the only judge, as Gordy thought they were great!They were crunchy with some sugar topping them.  They had a very ginger taste which was good, but as I said, for me they were too sweet.If you like crunchy sweet ginger cookies, this is the ticket for you.  Me? not so much."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"If you are a fan of ginger snaps then I believe you owe it to yourself to give these a try.I love ginger, and I thought these were really authentic -they really tasted like ginger, and not a watered down cookie with a bunch of other ingredients that made it taste more like a shortbread cookie with ginger flavoring...These cookies are completely organic, which made me feel even better about eating them.  (I mean, they are still cookies, but at least I can avoid some of the ingredients that don't add value to my health.)They had bits of crystalized ginger in them, and they tasted slightly spicy (because of the ginger) and, best of all, they snapped when I broke them.  So, they had ginger, and they definitely had SNAP: the best of both worlds!Recommended to those who want a more traditional ginger snap cookie, and who like cooking with fresh ginger root."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Very tasty cookies with just the right amount of snap and ginger. One star lost due to the fact that they got stale pretty quickly, even when the bag was tightly closed."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Ginger is a favorite flavor and these snaps really deliver. Often I find that ginger flavored baked good have a chemical taste that reminds me of soap, but not these cookies, the taste of real ginger shines through. I also love the fact that all profits go toward the Hole in the Wall Gang Camps, a worldwide network of facilities that give sick, disabled, and disadvantaged kids the opportunity to have a summer camp experience."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I enjoy eating ginger flavored things, and ginger snaps are no exception. This review will not take into account that these are vegan cookies, as I rarely eat vegan cookies, so I can't really compare that aspect to anything else.These cookies are hard, but I didn't find them too hard that they were inedible. They also have a strong ginger taste. It's incredibly intense, and these cookies are not that sweet. I personally thought they were slightly too strong. I plan to have these with some tea, as it will infuse the tea with ginger and make the cookies softer.If you are looking for an intense ginger snap cookie, then definitely try these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Wow, was I disappointed with these cookies!  I love ginger so I was really looking forward to a cookie that other reviewers referred to as spicy.  Well, yes, these cookies are spicy if you can actually chew them.  The bag I got was filled with cookies that were hard as rocks.  They were impossible to eat without ripping the roof of your mouth to shreds.  The first one I tried I actually had to spit out!  I thought that perhaps it was just a bad one and that maybe the other cookies would be different.  Let me say that they at least have solid quality control at the factory because they were all hard as rocks.  I even tapped one repeatedly really hard on the table and but it had no effect: it didn't break, crack, crumble or even shed a crumb or two - it was absolutely intact.  Try that with any other cookie!Our yard is filled with squirrels and sometimes I put out food for them, so I tossed one of these cookies out in the yard four months ago and it's still there!  Seriously.  It looks exactly like it did when I threw it out there!  Usually I have to hide sweet things in my house or my twenty year old nephew eats them, but I left these out on the counter and after trying one he's never gone back for another... that's never happened before. I ended up throwing them away because no one wanted them.I don't know how my experience can be so different from so many other reviewers - perhaps I got a bad bag.  I'm certainly not going to waste money on another bag to find out."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Loved the cookies. Reminded me of the ginger snaps my grandma used to make. Recommended for all.Sam Hendricks, author Fantasy Baseball for Beginners"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I'll preface this review by stating that I think  Own Newman-O cookies are better than Oreos.That's why I was a bit disappointed with  Own's ginger snaps.  The flavor was okay, but I would have preferred a bit more ginger flavor.  My real issue is that within the same bag, I had some cookies that were crisp (as one would expect from a ginger ""snap"") and others that were more like a soft molasses cookie.  Not that I mind soft cookies, but it just seemed odd to not know what I was going to get when I pulled the next cookie out of this bag.  Seems like a quality control issue to me.I didn't feel ill after eating any of these cookies so I assume there wasn't really anything wrong with them, but I don't think I've ever bought any other brand of cookie where the quality in the same bag varied so widely."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are my new guilty pleasure - worth every calorie. I had to order a case after trying the first sample bag. I just can't stop nibbling away at these cookies. They are absolutely addictive.They are very crisp and a bit hard, so if your teeth are sensitive, plan on dunking these in your favorite beverage. The ginger taste is pungent, quite strong. They are loaded with tiny dried bits of candied ginger that turn chewy in your mouth. The ginger flavor is so intense - not for the faint at heart - that my mouth actually tingles with that ""ginger burn"" I enjoy so much.So if you like mild, boring, blah-tasting grocery chain wafers, stay away from these. But if your taste buds are ready for a wake up call, then these organic cookies are just the ticket."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"A lot of people are saying that this cookie is too spicy. Perhaps it is because most people have become accustomed to ginger snaps that don't actually have any ginger in them.Just like it's hard to find ""Ginger Ale"" with real ginger anymore, it's hard to find a ginger snap with that authentic, bite you back, spice.Everyone in my house likes real ginger ale, and a couple of us love it. It fell down the same lines as to who liked these cookies, and who loved them.Great ginger bite, not too sweet, nice molasses flavor."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"First impression, very firm, dense texture, almost ""shred the roof of your mouth"" sharp when you bite into it.The initial taste isn't horrible, it's when the very bitter aftertaste kicks in that you start feeling like you want to turn off your taste buds.I had hopes for this product, that it didn't even come close to filling.With a name like """" I was expecting a high quality, tasty, organic, product.It might be organic, but tasty and hiqh quality don't apply in this case.Even my grandson tried one (almost 4 years old) if you have ever been around toddlers or preschoolers, it would be rare to find one that would say ""NO"" to a second cookie. However, my grandson didn't care for the taste of the cookie either, and he actually really likes Ginger Snaps!When offered a second one of these cookies, he backed away from me and told me ""NO"".This has left me with most of the bag of cookies, and a new inside, family joke, ""be good or I will give you a cookie"", because nobody in my family would try more then one other than me, and that was purely for research purposes on my part, since I did not like the taste."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Bite the tongue! Crispy and tart. My kind of cookie. Almost HOT with that really old-fashioned taste.Just a couple at a time was all I needed for the sweet tooth but weren't very sweet really. I do like all the  Own products I've used and this one is at the top of the list.If you like ginger snaps and you like them ""snappy"" then this is your kind of cookie!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I am married with two kids and a grandma who lives upstairs. We all love sweets and aren't very picky about which ones we eat. But no one liked these. They were that terrible. My 8 year old refused to swallow and my 2 year old made the worst face, spit it out and said, ""no more cookie."" I found them to be too crisp and very bland, reminiscent of cardboard. Yes I said cardboard. These are what I imagine cardboard to taste like. My grandmother loves sweets, but rarely buys them so she welcomes all treats. She didn't care for these and refused the bag. My hubby wouldn't try them after hearing our negative reviews and stuck w pie. These were the first sweet treat that I ever had to throw away."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I am a huge fan of ginger snaps so when I tried  Organic Ginger Snaps I was pleasantly surprised at how good they taste!  They are also crunchy which give them the extra ""Snap"" (and they are a perfect compliment to coffee or tea!).  The flavor is distinctly ginger like but not too sharp and not too sweet.  They tasted very fresh as well.  The size of the cookies is on the small size so they are perfect for kids or for tea time!  Be warned, though... you could eat the entire bag!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I don't believe I would order these cookies again, but they were ok, just not a re-buy for me. Like typical ginger snap cookies they were hard, dry, and crunchy; however, the real ginger pieces had a slightly moist and chewy texture. The ginger flavor was quite strong and fairly natural tasting. I thought the cookies bordered on being overcooked and had a slightly bitter flavor. If what I have described sounds like something that you would like then these are for you! I like the flavor and consistent texture of regular grocery store ginger snaps better."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These Ginger Snaps are made with organic flour and organic sugar, and are also vegan.  The ingredient list is pleasantly short and includes both candied and ground ginger.  I suspect the combination of the two types of ginger is why the cookies have such a strong bite.  These are not a mild cookie; they are very spicy and delicious.  Five cookies contain only 130 calories, and because of their kick, I only ate one or two cookies at a time.  This makes them a pretty low calorie snack.  My only real complaint about the cookies was the texture.  I like either a moist, soft cookie or one that is crisp and a little brittle.  Unfortunately, these were hard and chewy, almost as if they were stale.  I definitely wouldn't serve them to anyone who didn't have strong teeth."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"As someone who likes organic products and gingersnaps, I was intrigued by this product. First off, let me point out that these are NOT your mother's gingersnap cookies. They are very clearly something that came from a factory and were mass-produced, and when I first tried them after opening the bag, they were very tough to chew, pretty dry. I would have a drink with them, especially since they were a lot spicier than other gingersnap cookies I've had. They do, however, keep VERY well, despite not being loaded with preservatives. Just roll up the bag and they'll stay good for several days at least, after which point I actually found them more enjoyable as they'd softened slightly.All-in-all, not the greatest store-bought cookie I've ever had, but if you are into organic products and like gingersnaps, these are definitely worth giving a try."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I really like Ginger snap cookies, but these ones have almost a sharp ginger tone to it.  It's a very small, hard, crunchy cookie.  You have to bite down pretty hard to crunch it.  Then there is a burst of sharp ginger flavor as you chew on the little bits of ginger in the cookie.  The little bits of ginger do get a little gummy like and can get stuck in your teeth.  This cookie definitely packs a punch.  If you like a sharp ginger cookie and you don't mind if the cookies are hard, then this is the cookie for you.  If you like soft, moist, chewy cookies, then you won't like this.  If you're used to generic store-bought ginger snaps, then the strong ginger flavor in this cookie may surprise you.  I think this is a quality cookie and I don't feel guilty at all snacking on them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"If you like ginger, you are going to love these cookies.  They are made with real candied ginger and - true to  Own mantra - they are made with more than 70% organic ingredients.  There are no hydrogenated fats, no fake colors or flavors, and they are totally vegan (no dairy/no eggs were used in this production of these cookies).Really scrummy cookies for the ginger fan.  Pick up a bag to pack in someone's lunch, take on the airplane for a snack, or just to have with a glass of milk."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are delicious!  Definitely for a more sophisticate palate, as they are very crunchy, and their flavor is rich, with a true ginger flavor.  The flavor really evolves from the first bite until after you've swallowed the last bit.  They leave your mouth with an almost spicy feeling.  You will likely not overindulge and eat the whole bag all at once, but you will enjoy every bite!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Ginger snaps:  The name says it all, you want ginger and you want snap.  These have the ginger for sure, with a lingering burn in the throat.  And they sure have snap, they're very crunchy.I'm taking a point off because I think they go overboard on both accounts.  The lingering burn seems a bit excessive, although some might really enjoy it.  But the crunch really seems like a flaw, these cookies are bordering on hard.I still ate the whole bag though.  :)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I generally enjoy ginger cookies but these were not to my liking.  The ginger was very strong which is probably a plus to some people but I prefer a more subtle flavor.  The biggest problem was they were incredibly hard (break-a-tooth hard) and seemed a bit burnt.  My daughter (age 21) also tried them and thought they were awful."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Standard disclaimer:  Own Organics Ginger Snaps were obtained via the Amazon Vine program.Ok, my wife and I tried these ginger snaps and came to the same conclusion:  They're spicy and hard.The ginger is pronounced.  REALLY pronounced.  You have to eat this with a cup of tea or a glass of milk to cut the sharpness.  Another reason to have liquids on hand: these little suckers are HARD.  Serious crunch going on here.  However, a dunk in the aforementioned tea will soften them right up.I dig ginger snaps with a hot cup of tea, so you'd think these would be right up my alley.  BUT, the spice is a touch too harsh and the hardness of the cookie takes a serious dunk to get over.  Still, I can deal. Especially on a cold day.However, if you're looking for a snack cookie you can munch right out of the bag, these are NOT for you."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"This cookie offers the American version of gingerbread (i.e., the flavor of mixed spices and molasses including enough ginger to impart a mild bite) in a crunchy form.  It uses a mild-flavored molasses which does not overpower the spices.If you like gingerbread in a small, crunchy bite-sized format, you will love this cookie.  Personally I prefer  Own ginger oreos for crunchy ginger, and I would have liked this cookie to be in a soft-bake format."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies are crumbly in texture and small enough for one bite.  The taste is pretty spicy, so you should have a glass of milk at hand.  They are certainly different from other store bought ginger snaps, but I'm not sure they are any better.  I liked them, though."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Yep, I did a blindfold taste test.  I got the  Ginger Snaps, placed them aside, and went to the store and bought Nabisco Ginger Snaps.  I did NOT open either package.  I had my wife open the packages.  She broke the cookies into bite size, handed them to me and I did 5 separate taste tests.  Of course, I had my glass of milk to complete the full test.  She mixed them up, different  brand in different order.  It would have been a better test if I could have gotten a third brand......could not find one.  The words that I used to describe Nabisco (as it turned out) Ginger Snaps were subtle, and  chewy.  The words that I used to describe  Ginger Snaps were more vibrant, more ginger taste, crunchier, and more ginger flavor.  Across the board....all 5 times.....I rated the  Ginger Snaps superior to the Nabisco brand.  I cannot compare against any other brand.  Seems I like the  Ginger Snaps.I have never actually done a taste test without kinda knowing the end result.  In this case, I swear that I never opened the boxes.  I had no idea what they looked like, so I really was doing this taste test thing for real.  I like Ginger Snaps....have not bought them for years......my kids don't really like them.  But they are all in college, so I can now buy things I want to eat.  I like Ginger Snaps.......with a tall glass of milk.I actually like both brands, but I give the  Ginger Snaps points for being more what I THINK a Ginger Snap should taste like.Hope this helps.  Good eats."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'll start with positive (always the best, right?).  My husband LOVES these cookies, seriously loves them.  I can tell you that I dislike them for the same reason he loves them so this cookie with be a love it or hate it kind of thing.  These are no kidding Ginger snaps.  No fake stuff here.  It is flavored with real ginger, to the point that there are even little bits of candied ginger in the cookies.  This is what my husband loves about them, the extra zip every time you bite into that bit of ginger and chew on it (it is big enough that you do chew on it).  I do not like that zip from the chunks of ginger, I couldn't finish the first cookie I ate out of the bag.  My husband happily finished off the entire bag in 2 days.Bottom line... if you love ginger and things that have a little bit of bite to it then you will love these ginger snaps.  They are worth trying and I absolutely LOVE the  brand.  (especially the marinara sauce.. just sayin')"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies really have some zip.  The ginger flavor is just right.  The cookies I sampled were burnt on the bottom and hard but so tasty I will give them another chance."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are very good, but I'd only recommend them if you really love ginger snaps, because they go all out to be authentic. The ginger taste is very strong and the cookies are actually spicy, with a strong ginger aftertaste. They're also quite hard! If you like authentic ginger snaps, definitely give these a try. I'm not a huge fan of this type of cookie so for me they were just okay, but I can see how they'd be a huge hit with people who love ginger snaps. The ingredients are remarkably natural and not a huge list of unrecognizable chemicals. The bag is easily resealable, plus it's a generous size. Check these out if you like your ginger snaps very gingery and very snappy!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Crystallized ginger is eaten like candy in my house, so you can better believe I was thrilled to see these cookies.  The individual cookies are not overly large, which is a good thing since they are packed with real bits of crystallized ginger, giving them a slightly spicy zing.  If the cookies were bigger it might be too much.  They are crunchy, but not to the point that they crack and crumble everywhere.  I tried them with hot coffee as well as cold milk and they went well with both."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"First off, the flavor of these cookies is excellent. TheY really have that spicy fresh/candied ginger bite. Unfortunately, the overall texture and density of the cookie doesn't do justice to the flavor.The cookies are very hard and dense, much like peppernuts. But they're too big to get away with it like peppernuts do. So instead they just seem too hard and kind of stale.I did like that there wee lots of funny odd-shaped cookies, not all perfectly uniform factory specimens. I don't know whether mine weree flawed or this was by design, but I thought it charming.If you're going to crush these for a recipe, for instance, pumpkin pie crust, they would be outstanding. They're also great dunking cookies for tea and coffee--here the hardness really works. But on their own, they just come off as stale, dry cookies with a great ginger kick."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The best ginger snaps are hard, crunchy, and gingery with a touch of heat and without cloying sweetness.   Own Organics Ginger Snaps succeed as far as I'm concerned.These cookies are small -- which I also like.  They go especially well with an afternoon cup of coffee.People who prefer big soft sweet cookies may not like these -- they are an authentic ginger snap.  I thought they were delicious as did the rest of the family -- and we will be purchasing these in the future."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Thank you  for your  Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies. My husband loves ginger snaps but hasn't found any in the states (he's Canadian) that he has liked. He loved these and said they were closest to the flavor of his Mother's cookies.Thanks again and I highly recommend these cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Well, these didn't last long around the house.  Nor did I get to sample all of them despite the fact that I, and not my wife and son, am the reviewer around here.  Suffice to say that these were a big hit. They've got a strong ginger bite to them, so you don't want ginger taste in your ginger snaps, these aren't the cookies for you. But if you like ginger, they're great.  They are very crunchy, so again, if you like soft, not the ones for you. But if you like snappy, they're great.  They aren't at all too sweet, which is often a complaint of mine with regard to cookies and snacks.  And did I mention they're very gingery? Linger in your mouth, flavor-pop gingery. the all-organic is an obvious plus.  The package comes with a bit of tape to help you reseal it once you've opened it. To be honest, it won't get much use--once you open it, they'll pretty much be gone.  Highly recommended."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"This review is for  Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies.These ginger snaps taste good.  The cookies are about 1.25"" in diameter.  The right amount of ginger and the right amount of sweet.  Although some cookies are crunchy and slightly hard, and others are slightly more chewy possibly due to a larger percentage of molasses in individual cookies.  The bag has a resealable tape to seal the bag, yet it is not as effective as a zip lock, but it works. I prefer another brand of organic and natural ginger snaps over these cookies, but these are still quite good."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies have a decent texture and a very strong ginger taste, so they should be superb for anyone who really loves ginger."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Let me start by stating that Ginger Snaps are my favorite cookie, so I went into this predisposed to liking the product. However, these little babies are mouth blissfulness! Just the right amount of sweet, with a great ginger burn to finish...Yum! The bag I received was very well done, so the cookies were perfectly crispy, with a soft center. Best Ginger Snap I have EVER had! These are going to be a staple in my house from here on out! And they are Dairy and Egg Free, so they are perfect for a multitude of folks who have allergies. Straight up win! So, so happy to have found this product!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"On the plus side, both my son and I loved, loved, loved the taste of these. These really are snappy ginger snaps. But on the minus side, my mother was afraid to eat them, because they are so hard. She was afraid she'd break her veneers. So these cookies get a big thumbs up for taste, but a thumbs down too, because they are way harder then they ought to be."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I have to admit, I love ginger snaps.  To be fair, I love anything ginger.  Ginger slices with sushi, pure ginger ale, gingerbread, even the mixed drink 'Dark & Stormy' which has rum and pure ginger brew in it.  I love the bite & spice of ginger, so use that knowledge as a precursor for this review :)I love  products as a whole because of the natural ingredients his company has always used, long before the recent fad of organic and 'going green' food products had come along.  These organic gingersnaps fit right in with his other food products in that the ingredient list is short, all natural, and delicious.  The cookies themselves are crunchy and have actual pieces of ginger in them.  And you can DEFINITELY taste the whole ginger.  There is serious bite to these cookies (which I personally love)  Myself and my boyfriend took out half a bag together with no problem over coffee on a Sunday morning (this was purely unintentional to have cookies for breakfast, but hey, these things happen)Being autumn, these perfectly compliment this cool time of year and are perfectly paired with coffee or hot cider.  I highly recommend them if you are a serious ginger foods lover!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"It has the crunch of a ginger snap cookie, but the actual ginger taste was too overpowering--to the point where it kind of felt like it was burning my mouth. The ginger didn't hit me until after I chewed the cookie for a moment or so... and then WHAM!I had one cookie, and really did not want to have any others (even with my horrible sweet tooth).For those who love ginger snaps, I think you'll enjoy this. For the rest of you who aren't so crazy about them? I don't really think you'll like these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love ginger cookies! The more ginger the better. These  Own Organic Ginger Snaps are awesome. Ginger snaps are hard to find at the store. I was quite excited to try these as the other  Own products that I have purchased have been great.If I made a ginger cookie at home..these would be what I wanted. Just ordered more from Amazon as I don't want to be without them. Thank you!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I had high hopes for this organic ginger snap and unfortunately, I was disappointed. I don't know if it's because it is organic or just because of the kind of ginger snap this is, but the ginger flavor is so strong that I couldn't finish my first cookie! They are just about too hard to even eat. If you love a strong taste of ginger and you like hard cookies, then you might like these, but otherwise, stay away."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love these cookies!  The ginger flavor is there, bursting in my mouth as soon as I take a bite, and the addition of the candied ginger to these snacks is quite good.  I think I'll buy some more of these when I get a chance!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love these cookies! They are hard cookies and have a very strong ginger flavor, so much so that it is pretty spicy.  My kids hate them, they're absolutely not the type of ginger bread cookies that kids usually like (i.e., typical gingerbread men.)  These actually burn my mouth because they're so spicy. They are much more like old fashioned ginger snaps, as the name states.I've been a Newmans fan for many years, and like many of their products. These are great, and I actually ordered them expecting that nobody else in the house would like them. So, as planned, they've become my own private stash for a nice afternoon break with tea."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I like this company and was predisposed to loving these cookies, but they were simply not gingery enough for me.The texture was excellent, but the flavor was bland."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I loved these cookies.  I will have to put them high up in the cupboard to ration myself because I could easily eat the whole bag in one sitting.PROS:*Crispy, snappy texture*Strong ginger flavor*Over 70% of the ingredients are organic*Ingredients list is pretty basic--NO mysterious chemical names strung together for 10 lines*5 cookies for 130 calories -- decent bang for the caloric buck*2% Calcium and 1% Protein, which is pretty decent for a cookieCONS:*Strong ginger flavor may not appeal to all*May not meet the threshold for those that need a low-fat cookieSummary:  Great tasting cookie with crunch.  I'll be looking for these my next shopping trip."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Gingersnap lovers (like me), will be delighted with these organic, bite-sized cookies which are packed with the flavorful zing of fresh ginger.Each little cookie (about half-dollar size) is a crunchy (VERY crunchy) mouthful of sweet candied ginger, molasses, with a hint of peppery fresh ginger. About as authentic as gingersnap taste gets, unless the cookie is homemade!Serving size is 5 cookies (at 130 calories), and even though the cookies are small, 5 are plenty per serving, since the flavor is so intense.My family loved them, and I'll certainly buy them in the future!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I was glad to see a new product in the  Own line, and hooray, hooray, this one is vegan.  I love  Ginger O's, so I wanted to try the ginger snaps.The little foil bag is filled with cookies that are about the size of a quarter, which you think would make it easy to overindulge, but each bite-size cookie packs a gingery zip, so definitely best not to overindulge.  It's made with candied ginger and powdered ginger, along with molasses, an absolute must in any ginger cookie (at least in my opinion).  I found them very tasty and crunchy (maybe because it's hard to reseal the bag properly) and I definitely recommend them to anyone who loves a real ginger cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love the taste and smell of ginger, and I really love ginger snaps. These ginger snaps definitely have some real bite to them and a good kick of ginger. You can actually see the crystallized ginger pieces in the cookies. I don't do the whole organic thing, so these are a bit pricey, but they are good."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I confess I do not like ginger, I got these for my husband who like gingery gingersnaps, and well... he loved them! Crunchy, fresh-tasting, and spicy! Enjoy a nice cookie break with these!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I've been a baker since childhood.  The first cookie I ever made was the Tollhouse chocolate chip cookie.  I've also made ginger snaps before and while mine are considerably larger than these quarter-size snaps the taste is similar.  Full-bodied spices, sweet, but not too sweet, and crisp.  In other words, these cookies pass the 'homemade' taste test.  The ones I received were also a little burnt on the bottom, which I kind of like.  To each his/her own.  So, I like my ginger snaps a little burnt on the bottom.  Don't judge me! :o)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I really like these ginger snap cookies, but they may not be for everyone. They have a strong ginger flavor, however a little light on any cinnamon/nutmeg flavor. They are thicker than the gingersnaps I ate as a kid, but I personally like the meatier, thicker cookie because it gives the cookie a strong crispy, crunch that goes extremely well with my morning hot tea or coffee."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are very crispy with a very strong, fresh ginger taste.  Some may think the ginger is overly strong but I love ginger so I really enjoyed them.  The ginger has an aromatic flavor like that of fresh ginger.  Very good ginger snaps."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I received this package from the Amazon Vine program.  I ordered it because I've always loved gingersnaps, and I've felt that Paul Newman baked good products are generally a step or two above the rest of the offerings on the baked goods' shelf.  The bag of cookies was small, but packed full of flavor.  I love gingersnaps which have candied ginger in them.  The little bits of ginger kind of stick to my teeth and they leave a deliciously peppery bite after I've swallowed the cookie.  It's hard to find potent gingersnaps, and Paul Newman seems to have answered my desire for flavor.  However, these cookies are dangerously hard for my teeth.  On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being soft like a Lofthouse iced cookie and 10 being harder than a pretzel rod, this cookie is probably an 11 or 12.  In order to bite into one of the cookies, I had to line the cookie up with an incisor tooth and crunch down hard on it. Having just broken out a filling in a molar by biting down on a large mint Life-Saver, I am more careful with the texture of things I am eating. I learned to eat these gingersnaps after dunking each cookie in a cup of hot coffee for a second.  The actual cookies appeared to be burned on the bottom, but there was no burned flavor from the very dark color. I would recommend this cookie to people with strong teeth, but not for people who wear braces, have crowns or bridges, or weakened tooth enamel."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021," Own Organics Ginger Snaps, are crisp rounds with candied bits of ginger that have some kick. Addictive chews that keep you going back for more. My wife likes them a lot, very spicy--probably the spiciest cookies she has tasted."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"My family and I love gingersnaps, so we were excited to get to review this new cookie made by the Paul Newman company  Own.  Overall it is an excellent cookie, a snack for cool, crisp fall days spent outdoors on a rocking chair or a porch swing.This cookie is organic, made with organic flour and organic sugar.  The ginger taste is powerful, and candied ginger is used (instead of powdered) for the key ginger ingredient.I used this cookie as a snack in my children's lunch boxes for school, and as a snack for my husband at work.  I ate them at home with regular coffee, which in my opinion emphasized the strong ginger flavor.In summary:  Own organic gingersnap cookie is a very good, somewhat healthy cookie that will appeal to people who enjoy organic products"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies delivered a smooth ginger flavor without the peppery aftertaste.  They are small cookies, and it would be easy to eat through a package in one sitting.  I enjoyed them with tea, but the flavor would go well with milk or coffee as well.  I would recommend these for the cookie lover."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies are small, hard and very crunchy.  Nice ginger flavor with pleasant ""afterburn"" in the back of the throat.  I like the texture but I'm not too fond of the small bits of candied ginger that are mixed into the cookies - they have a toffe-like consistency and they tend to get stuck in my teeth.  Other than that, these cookies are good, and it always feels nice to enjoy a snack made with natural ingredients.  The only way these could be better is if I made them myself (without ginger chunks in 'em.)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I like ginger snaps, but these are *GINGER* snaps, definite stress on the ginger. The cookies contain both candied and powdered ginger, but no cinnamon or nutmeg - it they do, then they fall into the category of ""spices,"" which is found at the end of the list of ingredients.The cookies themselves are quite interesting, very gingery and crisp. Children will probably find them a bit overwhelming, but adults will find their taste interesting. I find they go well with coffee or tea, or a nice flavorful schnapps.(Review of  Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"This is a little hard to bite ginger snap, but if you dip it in milk or coffee then you may get to enjoy this stuff. The manufacturer claims that this is a Vegan cookie with no artificial flavor or no trans-fatty acids, but I think this is a product of Mother Nature. On the positive side, ginger is known to decrease pain from arthritis. It may also have cholesterol lowering properties. Preliminary research also indicates that ginger may have positive effect on anxiety.Actor Paul Newman founded this line of food products,  Own, and he established a policy that all proceeds, after taxes, would be donated to charity.

"Amaurot Cookies",2022," Own Organics Ginger Snaps are delicious. They have an awesome ginger flavor. Also, some cookies are crunchy and some chewy. This is a great all natural organic cookie too. It's so difficult to find tasty ginger snaps these days. For 6 bags at $2.50 a bag, a great product at a great price. I highly recommend these cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are small, (about 1 inch wide, very very crisp, and very very ""gingery.""  Of all the brands of ginger snaps I've tried, these are the best.  The taste is real, the texture is hard and crispy, and I could eat the whole package if I tried."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I adore ginger snaps, and I think that most all of  Own products are excellent.  The company uses top quality ingredients, nothing artificial, and they donate most (all?) of the profits to various charities.That said, these are excellent cookies IF you love your ginger snaps really (and I mean REALLY) gingery.  These ginger snaps snap back.  I like my ginger snaps just a little sweeter.  But I have to admit that once I got used to the heat that these cookies generated on my tongue, I finished the entire bag in a couple of days.  I liked them best with a glass of milk to take away some of the sting of the ginger -- even dunking helped.  I think these would make a really interesting crust for a vanilla cream pie, also.I will be purchasing them again.  But these are probably not cookies for children, unless they have sophisticated palates."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I've long been a fan of  Own Organics, and these cookies did not disappoint. In a word, they are delicious. They have just enough sweetness and are a perfect snack. These are also suitable for vegans. One caution: there is a fair amount of sugar per serving. Granted, the sugar is organic cane sugar, but it is still sugar nonetheless. While these aren't health food, they certainly are better than some of the other cookies on the market and fine for an occasional treat."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"In my mind there are two types of ginger snaps...soft and chewy and hard and crunchy.  Just so you are aware, these are the crunchy kind.Like most gingersnaps they're fairly low in calories.  Each cookie is about the diameter of a half dollar and based on the nutrition info (5 cookies = 1 serving = 130 cal) they're about 25 calories each.Gingersnaps also range in the flavors...this one has the molasses defined and some complex spice flavors...ginger is fairly predominate though...a little harsh, but if you like that good enough.Pretty good all in all.  Nothing special - don't know if I'll buy them in the future, but I'm enjoying munching them and when I'm in a gingersnap mood these would certainly fulfill the craving so good enough!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These are a bit different than your average variety ginger snap.  With actual bits of chewy, candied ginger and strong spice that's zingy with a hint of a bitter aftertaste.  Not unpleasant to me, but I can see where some might not like it.  Personally, I find the complex, strong flavors interesting and tasty.  I like 'em.The cookies are very crisp (hard) so they'll definitely snap!  Great for dipping in hot tea or with ice cream."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I love ginger snaps, but have a hard time find just the right cookie.  Some are too hard, some are too spicy, some are too soft.  I had found what I thought were the perfect ginger snaps and then my grocery store stopped carrying them!  I was so disappointed!These are just right!  They are crispy with just the right amount of bite.  I'm a fan and I know I will not be sharing them--they are all mine.Perfect for the ginger snap fan in your life!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These little cookies are great!  I like to eat less sugar, so many things taste too sweet for me.  These cookies do not - they're perfect for my adult taste buds!  There are tiny pieces of crystallized ginger that you can see in the cookies, which add a really nice real ginger flavor.  These are so wonderful with a mug of steamed cider!They are very crunchy cookies, which I find deeply satisfying.  They are not chewy at all, so if that is what you are looking for, you are in the wrong place.The ingredients are natural and mostly organic, which is great for the planet.The bag is small -- 6.5 ounces -- and the cookies are small at about the size of a half-dollar coin.  But because of the depth of ginger flavor, I am satisfied with four cookies.Highly recommended!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm a big fan of most of  products and I appreciate that these cookies are organic, not artificial and don't have any hydorgenated oils, or trans-fatty acids. I don't care that they are vegan however I know some people might be looking for that but I'm just looking for a good ginger snap that's relatively healthy and for that there are far better options. First of all, these cookies are dry and hard as a rock. I know ginger snaps are sometimes crisp but you could chip a tooth on these things. Also the flavor is not my favorite. The ginger flavor is a little strange and they have a very strong orange taste. Overall the flavor of these cookies is just too overpowering. I did not finish the bag and would not buy these again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I LOVE ginger - anything ginger.  I was psyched to try these.  These cookies do have a very intense spicy ginger flavor. You will love that if you are a real ginger fan, otherwise that could put you off.  My only complaint is that they are SO hard...  if you prefer a chewier ginger cookie, these are not for you."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Pleasingly chewy with a strong, distinct ginger flavor, these organic cookies are the rare packaged cookies I'd bother to eat.Organic ingredients with no mystery chemicals, two forms of ginger for a potent ginger flavor.  Fresh out of the bag, they're almost soft, with a great chewy texture.  After sitting out/open for a few hours, the cookies harden to the more familiar ""snappy"" crunch typical of this kind of cookie.  I prefer the initial chewiness, but they are enjoyable at either texture.I'm a foodie and a home baker, so it's rare for me to find a packaged cookie that doesn't taste stale, artificial, or otherwise inedible.  These Ginger Snaps are the rare exception.  Recommended."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These are what I would call real ginger snaps. It reminds me of the ginger snaps I grew up with in England. To me the major downfall is that they are only bite-size. I would love a bigger cookie. These are great to dunk in a coffee but beware you cannot eat only one. I just wanted more after each one. Before I knew it the bag was empty. I will be looking for these again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I like  Own line of foods and trust their quality. These ginger snaps are crunchier and spicier than your average gingersnap. There are bits of real candied ginger in each cookie which explain the strong burst of flavor in every bite. If you love ginger, you'll love this cookie. I love them. My only complaint is that the cookies taste a bit too sweet for me. There is 130 calories per 5 cookies. Each cookie is the size of a half-dollar coin. You don't need a lot. A small handful delivers quite a treat."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies have a strong ginger flavor. As best I can tell, this strong flavor comes from little pieces of ginger root inside each cookie. If you chew the cookie, you will find they stick to your teeth, just like taffy. The tiny pieces remind me of a caramel candy that you can whittle away with your teeth till it fully dissolves. (Dentist would probably cry at the thought!) As others mentioned, they are great dunked in milk. At first I wasn't sure if I would repurchase, but by the end of the bag, I decided I wasn't bothered by the little ginger chunks. They actually make the entire cookie last longer~"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"If you love ginger, as I do, you probably are often disappointed by commercial ginger snap cookies.  Most of them, while promising the bite of ginger, are bland (and often too sweet).  Happily, this is not the case for  Own Organics Ginger Snaps. The cookies are small and crisp, and the delightful ""burn"" of real ginger floods your mouth after a few seconds. These also have identifiable chunks of real crystallized ginger which make for a delightful find as you chew.While the ""organic"" nature is not all that important to me, I did note that the organic ingredients were limited to flour, sugar and palm oil (!).  The ginger itself is not claimed to be organic.My wife and I both found  Own Organics Ginger Snaps to be among the best non-homemade ginger snaps we had eaten, and the bag's contents quickly disappeared."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These little gems are decidely adult. A crunchy two to three bite cookie with a ginger punch that nicely lingers ""just enough"". Bonus: they don't taste commercially made to me. The kids will likely want to leave them alone because they are not overly sweet. That's great because that means there is more left for me! These are a treat alone, lovely with hot tea and likely will form the crust of my holiday pumpkin cheesecake. Five cookies are allocated per serving at 130 calories, with 6 servings per package, they are fairly low in fat and teetering toward low sugar in comparison with other cookies. I will definitely buy these again,"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I was eager to try  Own Organics Ginger Snap.  As always, I checked the label first and was pleased.  The serving size of these small (6 gram) cookies is five (30g).  The 6.5 oz package contains about 6 servings.  It is made with 70% + organic ingredients including organic unbleached wheat flour, organic sugar, molasses, organic palm fruit oil, and ground ginger, this product qualifies as ""organic."" Ginger Snap cookies do not contain artificial flavors, colors, hydrogenated oils, or trans fat.  The recipe contains wheat, soy ingredients and monocalcium phosphate.Nutritionally, Ginger Snap is relatively low per serving in fat (3.5g), saturated fat (1.5g) and average in calories (130).  Per serving of sodium (180mg) and total carbohydrates (24g) are acceptable, but nothing to write home about. Ginger Snap are processed on equipment that may also process products containing peanuts, tree nuts and dairy. I sampled two cookies and found them to be delicious.  Caution:  It is difficult to limit yourself to just one serving.  They taste that good."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I never buy  Own due to the price, but I'm glad I got a chance to try these cookies. I'm a medium fan of ginger snaps and I think the hardness of most of these cookies is the main reason. These  are also very hard"". Don't eat them with tender or soft teeth!But they do taste strongly of ginger and they were sweet enough for me. I have a definite sweet tooth so sweetness was important to me. I don't know that they're that much healthier than the norm since I didn't have a package of a different brand on hand when I tried these, but I can't imagine ginger snaps being the worst type of cookie you can eat. I suspect the taste of ginger means they don't have to sweeten them as much as regular cookies (like sugar, peanut butter, choco chip, etc).I think the big thing to me is price. I wouldn't pay more than two-fifty for the bag size I received. Good, but not ""gourmet"", in my opinion."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Love the salad dressing and the Spagetti sauces.  Tried a few other foods from  Own.  Liked the food.  Liked the charitable noture.  Ordered the Ginger Snaps.  Drooled with anticipation when they arrived.  Took my first bite.  WHAT IS THIS!!!!??!When your mother made ginger snaps did she always remember to put in plenty of sage???  What! She forgot???!?  Well, bless her heart, that's what made them so GOOD; NO SAGE!!!  I tried several cookies just to see if this was a bad batch but the sage came through over and over.  It doesn't hit you immediately but, when it does, that's all you remember.  I gave one to my wife and my 34-year old daughter and they both had the same reaction (YUCK)!I'll see if my grand daughter likes them.  Otherwise I'll wait til later this month and use them to stuff the turkey."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I enjoyed these ginger snaps since they were crunchy with a strong flavor of candied ginger without being harsh. As I chewed them  I felt and tasted the tiny bits of candied ginger.  I describe myself as having a liking for strong and spicy flavors.  Some may find these cookies too spicy but if you can take a bit of heat these ginger snaps will be a  good choice for you. I received them through the Amazon Vine program and would try them again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I can't believe how good these are, especially for a store-bought cookie! Ginger snaps are one of my favorite cookies, but it's hard to find store-bought brands that are as good as the ones I make - not bragging, but my husband and I like our ginger snaps to be spicy with plenty of ginger. These delicious cookies fill the bill - I just got them this morning and I can't stop eating them! The good news is since they are organic and not loaded with a lot of preservatives and junk I can eat a handful with my coffee or tea and not feel guilty. I love how gingery they are, with actual bits of candied ginger baked into the cookies; if you're not a fan of REAL ginger and you don't like a bit of heat in your ginger snaps, you might want to give these a pass. I love the gingery bite, though, and will definitely buy these at the store."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Ginger snaps are by far one of my favorite cookies!  For a store bought cookie these are not bad.  They are what I think of as Tea Cookies.  They are VERY hard.  Perfect for dunking into hot unsweetened tea! Yum! The ginger is crisp & has a wonderful bite.  There are small bits of chewy ginger throughout the cookies.  The heat of the ginger lasts on the pallet long after finishing the cookie.If I had a choice of Ginger Snap cookies in the store, I would probably pick the Country Choice brand over these.  Why?  Because they have the USDA Certified Organic seal.  I've had them before & like them a lot.  The Country Choice brand does not have ginger bits in their cookies though.Overall if I am in a ginger snap kind of mood & I have the ingredients on hand, I will make them myself.  I prefer my cookies to have a little bit of softness in the center.  Otherwise these would be my second choice if a certified organic brand wasn't available.If you like to bake.  Earthbound farms has a cookbook with two amazing gingery cookie recipes.  One is for ginger snaps & the other is for lemon snaps.  Oh boy those lemon snaps are amazing!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"We are fans of  Own brands in this house and my fiance is a huge fan of ginger snaps.  These did not do it for us.  They had a funky after taste.  The cookies were really hard too, quite a snap. The ginger flavor was good, but the after taste was not pleasant."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"My entire family sampled these gingersnaps and offered opinions.  All of my children thought they were too spicy and had a bad aftertaste.  My husband, the one who really appreciates gingersnaps in our family, said that they were a bit spicy, but he liked the overall taste.  He also thought they were a little hard.I must say, I agree with the children on this one.  The cookies have a very strong spice taste- almost overwhelming.  My mouth burned when I ate them.  They are very hard- even harder than is typical for a gingersnap.  I like organic products and was really hoping to like these, but I was disappointed."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Now of course I knew that I was getting ginger snaps, so I wanted the taste of ginger to be here, but oh my goodness, for me these cookies are REALLY bitter, way more than the ginger snaps I tried before. I felt as if I burned my mouth a little bit, and after taste stayed with you for some time. And these cookies were really hard too."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I like ginger in baked goods like gingerbread, but I don't care for the taste of fresh grated ginger root, and these cookies tasted too much like fresh ginger for my taste. My husband likes fresh ginger, but didn't care for the texture of the chunks of candied ginger in the cookies. I love Paul, and we eat many of his products, but these cookies are a miss for us."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"As a kid growing up we enjoyed dunking windmill and gingersnap cookies into milk. It was a nice snack or a quick lunch when we were too busy playing to eat anything nutritious. That's probably why I developed a likeness for ginger cookies.For that reason this past holiday season I found a recipe for ginger cookies and baked gingerbread men cookies. Not that long after I discovered some very tasty ginger snap cookies made by  Own Organics Family Recipe Cookies made with organic flour and organic sugar.  Own Organics was formed by Paul Newman as a division of  Own in 1993 and became a separate company in 2001.Ingredients used in  Own Organic products are grown on farms that do not use artificial fertilizers ore pesticides for three years or more. The farms and processors have been certified by a third party, receiving Kosher certification by Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America.The ginger snaps are made with real candied ginger, molasses, unbleached wheat flour, organic palm fruit oil, ground ginger, leavening, soy lecithin, and other ingredients. The small cookies have a deep, rich ginger taste that lingers in the mouth. Like mom's ginger snaps, they are crisp and just right for dunking. I give them a B+. The nutritional information for the 6.5 ounce ginger snap package is: Serving Size - 5 cookies (30 g) Calories 130, Fat Calories 30, Total Fat 3.5g, Saturated Fat 1.5g, Cholesterol 0mg, Sodium 180mg, Total Carbohydrates 24g, Dietary Fiber 0g, Sugars 11g, Protein 2g.The package comes with a handy pull off tab that can be saved and used to reseal the package in case you do not eat all the cookies up in one setting."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Though I am normally a fan of  Own products, these cookies were terrible. Twice the thickness of other gingersnaps and very small (around 1 1/2 "" in diameter), they have little or no ginger flavor. This alone would have discouraged me, but the bag I received was also burned. They weren't simply very browned; there were burned spots around the edges, and the bottoms were blackened. The first (and only) one I ate filled my mouth with a strong burned taste that lingered. I checked the rest of the cookies, but all seemed to be burned. Hopefully, this is a quality control issue that can be resolved, but I will not be trying them again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I've bought and enjoyed  Own products in the past, and I like that their profits are donated to charity.  And I like cookies of all types and flavors.  So, I requested these cookies ...  Own Organics Ginger Snaps ... to review as part of the Amazon Vine program.  After receiving these, I gathered the family test team to try them.First the good.  The cookies are a little over an inch in diameter, and perhaps an eight of an inch thick, a good size for a snack cookie. They have a strong ginger and molasses flavor, which is critical for a good gingersnap cookie.  And the cookies are made from organic ingredients.  That about sums up the good.Now for the bad.  The cookies were very hard and almost unchewable.  They were a dark brown on top and almost black on the bottom, as in they might have been really overbaked.  The molasses and ginger had a harsh flavor, with an unpleasant aftertaste that takes awhile to fade.  Again, it was almost as if they'd been baked to the point of being burnt.  My wife, who loves the occasional ginger snap, immediately commented that these were the worst gingersnap cookies she'd ever had. My youngest son, who's never met a treat he didn't like, refused a second cookie.  None of my crack test team liked them or wanted more.  So I've eaten the rest of the bag myself, partly to see if they grew on me, and partly to make sure that it just wasn't a few bad cookies.  Unfortunately, they neither grew on me or nor got any better the deeper into the bag I ate.I'm thinking maybe I got a bad bag of cookies ... I have a tough time believing a firm with the deserved good reputation as  Own would consider what I received to be something they'd put their good name to.  But I have to rate what I've been provided, and I'm giving them a generous two stars."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"You will definitely need good teeth to eat these cookies!  They are not just crispy.....they are almost like trying to bite into concrete.  I love  products & wanted to love these organic ginger snaps, mainly because they are organic,  but they leave a lot to be desired.  I don't know if it was just the batch I received  or if they are supposed to be this way, but they are almost burnt.  The bottoms are very dark, almost black.  They also left a bad after taste that both my husband and & I noticed.  They just did not taste good.  They taste nothing like the flat ginger snaps of other brands.  I will not be buying these.......but still love other Newman products."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I grew up with the over-sugared gingersnap cookies as a child, so I was not expecting the flavor of these Newmans. I've had other  products in the past and they all sort of follow the same general theme - organic ingredients and a more ""mature"" flavor. By ""mature"" I mean that many of their cookies and snack lines are geared more towards adults than kids - they are not super sugary and their flavors are mellow and more delicate. It's not quite the case with these gingersnaps. The cookies are very hard and the flavor is like biting into a ginger root. Ok maybe it's not quite that bad, but you can seriously taste ginger in every single bite - any sweetness is an afterthought.I like the cookie in general - the flavor is good, the organic ingredients are a bonus, but honestly it's not my favorite gingersnap. I think the gingersnap is a cookie that really lends itself well to the sugary flavor to help balance out the bite of the ginger. I wish these had a little more sweetness to them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"If you love eating healthy, you know you can always turn to  Own.  Own offers all natural products without any of those preservatives you find in most foods. I've bought many  Own products, so when I tried the  Own Organics Ginger Snaps, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.If you love ginger snaps, you have to try these as they're made with organic flour, organic sugar and real candied ginger. They're all natural; contain no artificial flavors or colors; no hydrogenated oils; no trans-fatty acids; they're dairy free; egg free; and vegan. Unlike most ginger snaps you buy in the store, these really pack a ginger punch--you'll be impressed with the spicy ginger taste and crunch. And if you're counting calories, 5 cookies are only 130 calories.The nutritional facts are as follows:Serving Size - 5 cookies (30 g) Calories 130, Fat Calories 30, Total Fat 3.5g, Saturated Fat 1.5g, Cholesterol 0mg, Sodium 180mg, Total Carbohydrates 24g, Dietary Fiber 0g, Sugars 11g, Protein 2gNot bad for a little indulgence. Just beware--they can be very addicting."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies are not for someone who is shy or uncertain about ginger.  The flavor is strong, with a little ginger burn to it.  I love ginger, and buy ginger snaps, candied ginger, or even ginger Altoids every now and then.  From the first bite of these cookies, I knew I'd love them.And I do... mostly.  The flavor is great, the texture is hard but not as rock-hard as the ginger snaps in my local supermarket, and they hold up well when dunked in milk or tea.  I keep wandering back to the bag to snack on one or two.  Then one of the candied ginger pieces gets stuck in my teeth.It's a great idea, at least in theory.  Adding candied ginger makes the flavor a little more intense.  But the texture is surprising--the small soft gummy ginger pieces contrast badly with the hard cookies.  And only flossing or brushing will convince the candied ginger to let go of its death grip on my teeth.  Ginger snaps and mint toothpaste are not a good combination at all.If they ever get rid of the candied ginger pieces these will be my favorite ginger snaps."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Ginger Snaps are an American tradition, like oatmeal and sugar cookies.  We who enjoy a really good cookie with our cup of coffee or tea are always on the lookout for a really good cookie.   Own brand of Ginger Snaps are just what we are looking for in a ginger snap.  It is crispy, much like a biscotti.  The candied ginger gives it a rich ginger flavor.  And the small size, about the size of old half dollar, is just right for dunking in one's coffee and popping in the mouth.  The fact that they are made of organic ingredients not only adds to their quality, but says that they are healthy, thus making it easy to eat more than just a few at a time.We have come to expect quality in all the various products marketed under the brand name, "" Own,"" and these ginger snaps honor that tradition."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"If you absolutely love ginger snaps then you will love these cookies! I loved the overall flavor because it had a strong ginger taste. I don't particularly like weak tasting ginger snaps.  The strong flavor may not be for everyone but I truly enjoyed them.  The only reason why I didn't give them five stars was because they were a little hard to bite into.  These were the hardest ginger snaps that I have ever had but other than that, they taste really good.  I also like the fact that I didn't experience any aftertaste which was a huge plus!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Having long been fan of  Own Popcorn, pasta sauces, and various salad dressings, I was interested to see what the company's foray into cookies might be like.I was pleasantly surprised by the taste most of all. It is unlike any other ginger snap I've ever eaten, that's for sure. The size of the cookie itself is thicker but smaller in circumference to the classics I'm used to eating. This is notable for reasons I'll get to shortly.The consistency is very crisp, almost brittle. If you're teeth aren't strong, you may want to dunk them in milk or coffee before you bite into them. And this is where the size issue rears its ugly head. The cookie itself is small enough that you may get 1-2 dunks to help soften them up a bit, but that's it. By then, the cookie remnant is so small you pretty much have to finish it off 'dry'.I would like to see the company try to add an ingredient that would help this texture issue. If it weren't for that, I'd give these little goodies a 5 STAR rating easy."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Mrs. Boilermate is from the Philadelphia area. One of the local treats there is Ivins Spiced Wafers, a ginger snap-like cookie that seems to evoke a ""love 'em"" or ""hate 'um"" reaction. Personally I love the crisp cookie and the fairly strong spice flavor. Other family members, however, call them ""hockey pucks.""Before ordering these from Vine I scanned the early reviews, and saw a similar trend. Now that I've tried them, I come down on the ""love 'em"" side. These are an adult cookie and would go well with a cup of tea.I like the crisp texture and the prominent, but not overpowering, ginger flavor. These cookies have tiny bits of candied ginger mixed in. This is a bit of a two-edged sword. While they contribute to the prominent ginger flavor, they are also gummy and stick to my teeth, hence the four-star rating. I did not detect any aftertaste.I can't comment on the effectiveness of the peel-and-stick tab for resealing the bag...I never needed it.I have been a ""fan"" of  Own products for years and these cookies have done nothing to change that.  is proof you can have an ethical business model and still be successful.Bottom line: I will buy these when they hit the stores here."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I had never had ginger snap cookies before this, so I thought I would give it a try.Maybe I just don't like ginger snap cookies to begin with?I thought it would be crispier, MUCH thinner, and with more ""baked,"" almost a burnt sugar, caramelized (think Creme Brulee) flavor, but instead, it was a very strong rooty, gingery flavor (which I guess makes perfect sense, since it's ""ginger snap cookies"").Rather, it is very thick, ticker than a waffer, and about the same size. I wish it were smaller, more bite-sized, and much thinner. It is hearty, if that is the flavor you're looking for, you would love it. I did not enjoy it as much personally.One of the reviewers said it's great because it's not very sweet... I would beg the contrary. It was quite sugary to my taste buds.Bottom line, if you were looking for a light snack, this is probably not for you. However, if you want very bold and hearty flavors, you might want to give it a try."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"We really enjoyed these cookies.  The first packaged disappeared very quickly.  The cookies are harder than I would normally purchase - but they soften quickly in your mouth and are great dunking cookies.  We dunked them in soy milk and flax milk.  They were quite enjoyable.  The size of the bag is perfect for adding to gift baskets.  I will be purchasing more for our family and some for Grammy's holiday stocking.  I highly recommend these cookies.  Enjoy!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Organic ingredients are only the first positive.The Intense Ginger flavor lingers on my tongue.  I feel like I can breathe it in. That is a real positive for me.Too many ginger cookies are blah.   Own are superb.  Crunchy and relatively low fat.  Finally someone who understands how much I relish a real hit of ginger.I'm not sure if I'll share them or hide them in the back of my pantry!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"For me and some of my family, these Ginger Snaps were too Gingery, too spicy. But one family member really liked them. So if you like very spicy, very gingery cookies then you might like these  Ginger Snaps. But if you tend toward milder tasting cookies then you probably will want to skip these Ginger Snaps. They would be good for dunking as they are very hard cookies so hope you like crunchy."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The first thing I do when checking out a new food product is to open the container and take in a deep breath, to smell what's inside.  These Ginger Snaps did poorly with the smell test, having very little ginger smell.  I then bit one in half, which was no easy trick.  These are substantial little cookies!  I let the first half melt a little in my mouth, which gave me the first indication of what a strong ginger flavor was in store for me.  I then began to chew the cookie, and noted the bits of candied ginger in the cookie.  Ginger flavor exploded in my mouth, and I mean REAL GINGER!  I'm a big fan of ginger, and have always enjoyed ginger snaps, but now I realize that I have never had an honest to goodness real ginger snap!  There will definitely be more of these in the house during the holidays."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These are a crisp classic gingersnap with the real bite of genuine ginger. I expect first rate from  own products and these organic gingersnaps  from the second generation of the Newman family do not disappoint.  The flavor is excellent and I'd say they seem quite high quality. I did enjoy these immensely. They were very firm and a bit hard to the tooth when I first opened the package but  softened quite a bit after a few days. One problem if you like a softer gingersnap is being patient enough to wait after opening the bag. the other problem  is  that, as a Vine member, I only got one bag. The bags are 6 and a half ounces  and while they contain quite a few cookies (around 30) competition in my household was fierce I did not get as many as I would have liked. I would buy these  they were very good on their own and with beverages. I did not have enough cookies to try using them in recipes that call for gingersnaps  such as crumb crusts and fruit crisps or the beef and cabbage dish My great Grandparents used to make  but I am certain that these would be great for those purposes."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I like many  Own products and love the concept--that all the profits go to such worthy causes including a camp for children with cancer.And ginger snaps are one of my favorite cookies, so I was happy when this product showed up on Vine. It's nice to be able to give a positive review to a product whose sale benefits so many people. Organic flour and organic sugar were examples of quality ingredients in use.So, imagine my disappointment when the bag arrived. Its a cute bag of cookies, and about 30 cookies with a removable tape to help seal it so they stay crisp. The first one I tried had a good snap and a strong ginger flavor--which I really liked and think ginger cookies should have. It also had the right balance of sweetness--some, but not too much.The second cookie was so different. One, crisp and fresh tasting; the other chewy (not in a good way) and a bit flat tasting. I thought maybe it was just a weird ""odd"" one in the batch, but...no. About half the cookies are one way, half the other. And they even look different--lt brown v. dark brown, curved like a vanilla wafer v. flat as the proverbial pancake. They seemed a bit over-baked and the after taste was not burned, exactly, but not pleasant.I thought maybe this was packaged just for Vine, but...no, it seems to be just the regular product. They're not inedible, they are made with organic flour and sugar, and they do go to a good cause. Just be prepared for the inconsistency and maybe use the kind you -don't- like to eat for baking or cooking. I ground up the flat ones to use with a pie (they'd be good on ice cream, too)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I have supported  Own brands when I am able and the quality is high. And I love Ginger Snaps, so I was looking forward too trying these. The cookies themselves are small and crunchy. These cookies I found too be delicious with just the right enough of ginger for spice and a hint of sweet. The ginger lingers as an after taste as you would expect. And they can be addictive. I had too stop myself from continuing too eat them. Five of these cookies are considered a serving and weigh in at 130 Calories.Only the Flour and sugar is labeled as Organic. I like that the advertising of ingredients is clear but would have expected a  Own Organic brand too be all organic. That may be asking too much. Also if you have allergies be cautious. These cookies are manufactured where products containing peanuts, tree nuts and dairy are processed. (So they may not be all dairy free!) This is disclosed on the back of the package after the list of ingredients but in its own paragraph so it is easy too find...if you are looking for it. I am sorry too say I have had another brand that taste better but these are good and I would get them again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I think I read that these did not have eggs in them.  Perhaps that explains the ""hockey puck"" texture.  They have a great taste, although they are a LOT spicier than most ginger snaps.  But they are very hard. Ginger snaps are always kind of hard, but these go way beyond normal.  I had to soak them in milk to really enjoy them.  They also had something kind of chewey in them.  It only became chewey after you soaked it.  I thought maybe it was the ginger, but couldn't be sure. Still, if you like ginger and you like it really spicey and you don't mind dunking your cookies for longer than normal, they're good cookies.  If you don't like dunking or you don't like spicey ginger-flavored foods, skip these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I have been a ginger snap fan since I was a tot. And I will admit that if I had tried these as a kid, I probably would not have liked them. But my fondness for strong ginger flavours has increased with age...and these are perfect...well, ok they are a little small (the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars).At about 2.50 a bag, with healthy ingredients...it doesn't get a lot better than this. IF (and only if) you like a strong spice of ginger...and if you like your cookies on the lower end of the sweetness scale."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I am a big fan of  Own products including their cookies but these were hard and had a very strong spicy ginger flavor.  It seemed as if some of the cookies were stale becuase they were so hard.  The ginger flavor is very pronounced and ginger lovers will enjoy these but it was overwhelming to me.  I threw out half the bag because every other cookie seemed to be stale/rock hard."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I like my ginger snaps spicy, and these did not disappoint. They are packed with flavor and have little bits of candied ginger inside. The biggest disappointment with a ginger snap is when the spice is too mellow, but these little cookies are really strong. They are also very, very ""crisp"". The company clearly wanted to emphasize the ""snap"" because they are pretty hard for your standard cookie. I usually like them a little less brittle, but the flavor was so good it didn't matter. I even dunked them in my tea to soften them up a little when the crunch was just too much.Be warned- these ginger snaps are not for the faint-hearted. We are talking ginger snaps that mean business!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"From the minute your tongue touches these cookies you will know this is going to be a good experience. As you crunch down and as the gingery flavor fills your mouth, you will probably think these are the best ginger cookies you've ever tasted. At least I feel that way. Now my husband couldn't stop saying ""Wow"" the entire time he was eating them because the flavor was pretty intense. The reason these are so good is because they have ground ginger AND candied ginger. Also these are made with organic flour and organic sugar so they are just superior in flavor to most store-bought brands. Even minutes after you eat these cookies you will notice a mild tingling in your mouth. If you love ginger these are the ultimate ginger cookies.~The Rebecca Review"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I generally prefer a soft and chewy cookie and I'm also not a huge fan of ginger snaps I've had in the past so I was very surprised at how much I liked these cookies. First, they are very crispy (perhaps the ""snap"" in the name) but after you chew them for a while they seem to melt a bit in the mouth which somewhat unusual for such a crisp cookie. The big plus though is a spicy (relatively speaking) ginger bite to the cookies. This is what distinguishes them so much from ginger snaps I've had in the past which are fairly tasteless. These really do have a wonderful ginger taste to them. All in all, a very difficult cookie to stop eating. I went through many more than I should have before closing the bag for the evening."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"First the good news: I love the spiciness of these gingersnaps. These cookies have both ground ginger and candied ginger.The part I don't like: perhaps because these are vegan, they don't have a very pleasant texture. They are more than just crisp, these cookies are  just plain hard.  For me this is a deal breaker, but for someone who likes to dunk their cookies in milk, these may be more likable."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Ginger snaps are one of my favorite cookies, and frankly I'll eat almost any brand when I'm in the mood for them.  That's how I know that not all ginger snaps are created equal. Far from it.   Own Organics Ginger Snaps really hit the spot with me. They're not over-sweet, and they have a nice, peppery quality -- a lot of snap with your ginger.  They also have bits of candied ginger floating in them, so along with a good crunch (They're not rock-hard like some others I could name, though.)you get little bits of chewiness making the texture very appealing.Normally I'd go on about how there's no HFCS, the sugar and flour are organic, and a bunch of other things related to relative healthiness, but seriously?  I love this cookie, and I don't think I'd care if it did have a lot of crap in it.  No, okay, it would make me unhappy, but not so much so that I'd never eat them again.I'm really impressed with these ginger snaps.   Own is a bit hit or miss for me, but these cookies are clear winners for a ginger snap junkie like myself."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Today I received and tried the  Own Organics Ginger Snaps. OMG! First of all, I love ginger snaps! They are one of my favorite cookies. The  Own Organics Ginger Snaps are delicious! They have a lot more ginger than other commercial ginger snaps. They are very snappy!As to the organic nature of the product, I'm not 'into' organic food. Maybe I should be because these are AWESOME. Not too sweet, very snappy and totally delicious!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"As others have mentioned, the cookies are a bit hard, so anyone with any dental work might want to give these a pass, but for those who endure, there's a nice reward at the end of the bite.  The cookies themselves are good, but the fun is in the bits of chewy candied ginger that are baked into the cookie.  That's where you get your heat, and if you like ginger, it's totally worth it!  If you like ginger snaps, these aren't your typical cookie but they are pretty good!  I would buy them again!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are very addictive.  Because they're small, you could eat quite a few without even thinking about it.  Their sharp ginger taste makes them a great companion to tea or coffee.  I could easily store a bag of these in my car for quick snacks on the go.  The resealable label is nice too.  I'll surely buy again."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"When my daughter was little, she would go to grandma's house to stay the night occasionally.  Grandma would get out gingersnaps after lunch and they would dunk them -  her cookies in milk and grandma's in coffee.  She started calling them coffee cookies.  Although those weren't organic, she only got them at grandma's.  She is now 16 and when I gave her one of these she said ""coffee cookies"" and grabbed more!  They are delish!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These little Ginger Snap cookies are very, very tasty, with a satisfying crunch at the beginning and a smooth, rich feel at the end.  It might be more of a crunch than some folks would want (which might even get worse if left on the shelf for too long), and if you don't want an intense, somewhat spicy, lingering ginger flavor, you should probably avoid these.For me, though, ginger cookies are usually kind of boring, so it was a real treat to introduce my taste buds to these organic goodies. The all-natural ingredients lean heavily towards the sugar (each cookie is 40% sugar!), but they are less fatty than the last ginger cookies we had (Anna's), and the powerful flavor kind of dissuades you from eating too many at once!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"If you are a ginger fanatic like I am, and like really spicy, almost hot, ginger-flavored items (like really strong ginger ale), you simply must try these delicious ginger snaps!  They are wonderful!  The ginger flavor really comes through, especially at the end of munching on one.  Plus, they are super-crunchy & not too sweet.  My wife & I love them!Each cookie is about the size of a Kennedy half-dollar, and here is the nutritional information from the packaging for those who are interested:Serving Size:  5 cookies (30 g)Servings Per Container:  About 6Amount Per Serving:Calories 130  Calories from Fat 30Total Fat 3.5g (5%)..Saturated Fat 1.5g (8%)..Trans Fat 0gCholesterol 0mgSodium 180mg (8%)Total Carbohydrate 24g (8%)..Dietary Fiber 0g..Sugars 12gProtein 1gHighly recommended to all the ginger addicts out there!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I really like the taste of ginger, but most ginger snap cookies that I have tried have only a mild amount. Not so with these cookies. They have a very strong ginger taste that will linger in your mouth even after you have finished eating the cookie. A negative review complains that this makes the cookie inedible, but for me it make the cookie absolutely delicious. It is all a matter of personal preference.5 cookies have 130 calories, 1.5g saturated fat, and 12g sugar. That does not qualify them as a health food, but they are healthier than other cookies, plus they are made with organic unbleached wheat flour and organic sugar (which are the first two ingredients listed). They are a little harder than I would prefer, but still taste great.Bottom line: If you like a strong ginger taste in a lightly sweetened cookie, this product will do the trick."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Never thought I'd see the day when a healthy brand touted real ""organic sugar"" as one of the main ingredients, or that I'd be thrilled to see it. There may be a few things that taste the same with high fructose corn syrup instead of good 'ol cane, but I have yet to find them. If I'm going to go all decadent and eat goodies, I want them to taste - well - good.I really like ginger snaps, they're a great comfort food and one of the few treats that have enough flavor that a handful is enough. I was looking forward to something a little more wholesome than my regular brand (you know the ones - look like cardboard, and probably as healthy) without going all organic-crazy and losing the flavor.I was surprised when I opened the package, most of the cookies were burnt on the underside, and about as hard as rocks. Well, they are ginger SNAPS, so I guess hard isn't bad, and they are easy enough to bite into, as long as your teeth are good. The flavor is definitely more ginger-y than the regular national brand, with tiny little bits of chewy ginger interspersed (bits have a consistency like chopped-up gummy bears). These little chewy pieces have some very strong ginger flavor, which is good if you love ginger.I think I'd really like these if they weren't burnt, but this batch has a singed flavor that just isn't very appealing. I might be willing to try them again, but I'm really wondering about their quality control if they could have this many bags leave the warehouse in this condition."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022," Own Organics Ginger Snaps are almost everything a ginger snap should be. They are hard (I hate soft cookies) and the ginger is fantastic--it fills your mouth with a real gingery wallop that lingers. The only thing I found disagreeable is that they were a little burned. The bottom of the cookies were a bit darker than I would've liked, and there was a definite overdone undertone. I don't know if it was the particular batch I sampled or if the product is meant to taste this way. That being said, I wouldn't refuse these ginger snaps if someone offered them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Being a big fan of other  Own products, I thought that these were worth a try.  Each package holds quite a few cookies- so it may make sense to plan ahead on using them before they go stale.  The crunch and texture were very good- and the small size of each cookie helped with portion control.  The flavor is the big thing, and may be a bit polarizing.  These are very ""spicy"" which I liked, but my wife did not.  Oh well- more cookies for me.  I found these to be perfect for a light post-dinner desert, and particularly good with coffee. Also, repackaged in baggies these go nicely with a brown bag lunch.  If you are a fan of ginger snaps, I think you will really enjoy these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Get a good bottle of hot ginger ale and sit down and eat a few of these things.  When I first got these I had high hopes and I was not disappointed.  I like hot ginger items and this fits the bill.  Yes, they are crunchy but hey, a good cookie is.  I like the fact that they are hard and not soft.  When you bite into the cookie the first thing you taste is ginger.  When you are done you taste ginger.  They are ginger cookies, not bland no taste cookies.They do remind me of a good ginger ale.  They will wake you up in a heartbeat and make you want more.  Give them a shot and you wont be disappointed.  However, if you are a ginger wimp, you should probably stay away.My box was well cooked, not burnt and tasted excellent.  I will be buying these in the future."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies have all of the quality you expect when purchasing  products.  Not everyone can make good ginger snaps.  These are very tasty and packed with the quality you will savor from the first bite.Another treat, they are bite size so you must be careful as you could eat the entire bag in one setting.  The packaging is also very good and insures the product is as fresh as possible.  They are perfect for a picnic, or concert, ballgame or wherever you will need a nice snack to complement other foods you may be bringing.Overall I was pleasantly surprised a good ginger snap is available in bite size portions."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Everyone in my family liked these ginger snaps--even my daughter. They have a nice, spicy ginger ""bite"" to them. Somewhat strong, but not overpowering, that lingers a little afterward. My kids pointed out that the cookies are very crunchy and on the hard side, so if your teeth or jaws aren't up to it you may want to soak/dip these in milk prior to eating."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I couldn't bite into these without dipping them in something to soften them.  So I poured some milk to dip them in and gave them a try.  These were so hard that I couldn't break them in two with my teeth.The milk solved this problem.  These are very tasty if you can soften them.  I LOVE the strong ginger flavor.  I didn't care for the candied ginger pieces, as they were hard to chew and got stuck to my teeth.  If these cookies didn't have that in them, I would give them a 4.  There are 130 calories in 5 cookies that are a little bigger than a half dollar.  I like the fact that they are organic, and made with natural ingredients.  I have always been a fan of the  Own products.If you love ginger, don't mind hard little crunchy candies getting stuck in your teeth, and love to dip these in coffee or milk, then give them a try."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I've long been a fan of the  Own brand and this item is no exception. Ginger Snaps are a common or garden cookie - known in may family as the best dunking cookie there is. Although these are small in size, they dunk really well. However what sets these cookies apart is their taste. You can taste the ginger and molasses very clearly and it retains that fresh out of the kitchen flavor. In my opinion taste alone lifts this humble cookie to the heights of a mini delicacy. Why don't you give them a taste and see?"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"We got our bag of ginger snaps this afternoon and I am ashamed (but happy) to admit that they are almost gone already.  These cookies are fantastic!  I have long been a fan of ginger snaps but have often been disappointed by the bland, tasteless versions I found in the stores.  Nothing was as good or as flavorful as Mom used to make.  It seemed that all the really flavorful brands slowly slipped away from the grocers shelves.  The only really great ones were imported and the exchange rate made them ridiculously expensive.  Then I found  Own.  I have always loved their salad dressings (not so crazy about their salsas but that is another review) and now I love their cookies.  With s satisfying snap! and a crunchy texture they also have delicious chewy ginger pieces inside to make them super flavorful.  The low heat of the ginger is just right and they are not too sweet.  They are fabulous and I now need to order more or find them at the local grocer. Buy these and you will not be sorry!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"My husband and I love ginger snaps.  I particularly like making triple ginger snaps where the secret ingredient is freshly ground pepper for the extra kick.  When I think of ginger snaps I think of flat, spicy, and crispy.  These organic  Own ginger snaps have that spicy ginger taste but are thicker than normal which make them harder to bite into.  If you don't like crunchy cookies, these aren't for you!  But if you do like ginger snaps then you'll like these.  I'm enjoying the ginger after taste as I type.Just to let you know, not all the ingredients are organic and it contains soy.Nutritional Information:Serving size 5 cookies (30g)6 servings per bagCalories 130Calories from fat 30Total Fat 3.5gSaturate Fat 1.5gTrans Fat 0gCholesterol 0mgSodium 180mgTotal Carbs 24gDietary Fiber 0gSugars 12gProtein 1 g"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I do, I really try to not eat cookies and other treats but ginger snaps, and  Own ORGANIC ones at that, free to sample?  This was more than I could resist.  So I set myself up with my bag of cookies and a mug of cold rice milk to research for my review.  These are very good - definitely crunchy but not rock hard and they yield very nicely when dunked.  They are bursting with real ginger flavor and the tiny chewy bits of ginger is the crowning glory.  For me there is nothing not to like.  If you love ginger you will love these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"If you like a real ginger snap cookie this is the best I've had. These are tiny super crispy hard cookies with a big ginger taste. They have candied ginger pieces in them so the strong ginger tastes lingers after you have eaten the cookie and I like that. These are amazing dunked in coffee or tea. A true ginger cookie with a big snap. AAA plus on this one, highly recommended!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These Ginger Snaps are sure to put a tingle on the tip of your tongue. They taste great.In addition they're made with real candied ginger and contain a minimum of chemical content.And - the profits go to charity!Well, I'm not so sure about that. Searching the  Own Organics website yields this vague statement, "" Own Organics was established as a division of  Own in 1993, and became a separate company in late 2001. Paul Newman has given over $200 million to thousands of charities worldwide since 1982"". Meanwhile, the  Own site explicitly makes the point that all profits of the original company go to charity.Nothing against daughter Nell if she charts a different course. But, the confusingly similar branding and the reference to Paul  charitable giving seem to trade on the original's cachet it a way that's borderline misleading.But the cookies are great.Four stars."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021," Own Organics Ginger Snaps taste yummy and rich. Five cookies contain only 130 calories.  Some of the ingredients used are natural organic unbleached wheat  flour, organic sugar, molasses, candied ginger, salt.  Cookies are crisp and full flavored.  Great for dessert, picnic, or a snack. Serve them up with a cold glass of milk--delicious!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I adore gingersnaps, I make them every fall.  Mine are tame compared to these!These little cookies (about 1"" in diameter) pack a spicy punch that can't be missed!  The candied ginger kicks the spice and flavor factors up so much, that these cookies are truly unlike any other I've tried.  These are very hard, though, so be careful.I loved these  Own cookies, but could only eat a few (5 cookies is the serving size anyway).  I actually ate them a few times with some pumpkin cream cheese - now that was a fantastic treat!  I would be happy to have these again, any time of the year."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I have usually found that "" Own"" products are very good, and these cookies do not disappoint.TASTE: They are very rich in home-made flavor - the ginger and the molasses are right up front where they should be. They are sweet enough, but not terribly sweet. They are VERY crunchy, and you'll find little bits of candied ginger in them. Ginger is naturally a bit spicy, and being rich in ginger, these have just a bit of zing to them.NUTRITION: they are made with organic flour and organic sugar. These are the first two ingredients listed, so that's important. Five cookies (each is about 1.25"" diameter) is the size of one serving, and weighs in at 130 calories, of which 30 calories are from fat.PACKAGING: The package includes adhesive tape that you can pull off and use to reseal the package to keep it fresh.I love them! Certainly the tastiest product I have reviewed for Amazon, much better than all those books."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"My mom is on a special diet to watch her weight and cholesterol.  Because of that most treats are off limits, however her doctor said she can have ginger snaps.  The kind she has been buying wasn't very flavorful or easy to chew. When I saw  listed in the Vine Voice I ordered a package right away in the hopes that these would be a notch above what mom was currently eating.  We each tried one and they are REALLY good.  If you like ginger then you are going to love these cookies.  They have a nice depth of flavor and the zing of real ginger.  They are also softer than most other brands."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These aren't your grandmother's ginger snaps.  Own has created a ginger snap that packs a real kick. The small (silver dollar sized) organic (organic unbleached flour and organic sugar) crisp cookies contain not only ginger as an ingredient, but also have tiny pieces of candied chewy ginger bits that give the cookies an overpowering ginger flavor that borders on ""spicy,"" and tingles the tongue. Some of my children liked them; others did not.Ginger-lovers will certainly like the cookies. Those who do not like ginger will want to stay away from them. Ideally, these are best served with milk (to counteract the spicy ginger) or with tea or coffee (for dipping).The cookies in our bag were a tad bit overdone, almost burned. It may be a ""family recipe,"" but I think I prefer chocolate chip, oatmeal, peanut butter, snicker doodles, or molasses cookies to these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021," Own and I have had a really good relationship thus far; I have at least liked, and most usually loved, every product I have tried from them. Their organic ginger snaps are no exception. The cookies are relatively small (somewhere between 1-1/2 to 2 inches in diameter), but they are filled to the brim with gingery goodness, which you would hope for in a ginger snap. I wouldn't think these would be for someone with a casual liking of ginger, but for those who enjoy it more, these are sure to please as far as flavor goes. As for the crunch, these are a hard cookie and not for those with gentle teeth, but they are, after all, a ginger snap. Ginger snaps are not known to be soft in any way, shape, or form. Rest assured that these won't break in shipment. My bag of cookies survived their journey even though they came in a soft envelope, which in turn was crammed into my cluster mailbox. However, when I opened the bag, I only found two broken pieces equaling a cookie. That's one tough cookie!As far as nutrition goes, it's pretty good: 5 cookies in a serving, 130 calories (30 from fat), saturated fat 1.5 grams, sugar is 12 grams (not great but it is a cookie so far better than most other choices). The ingredients in order: Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Molasses, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Candied Ginger (ginger, sugar), Ground Ginger, Salt, Leavening (sodium bicarbonate, monocalcium, phosphate), Soy Lecithin, Spice. While these claim to be Vegan, I see that it doesn't say 'organic sugar' listed in the ingredients to the candied sugar, just 'sugar', so one wonders about that. If you're unfamiliar with the  Own brand, it was co-founded by Paul Newman as a company where all profits from their food items go to various charities after taxes. It's a great cause that has fantastic, healthy, and quality products that while may be a bit pricier than other brands, won't break the bank.A little note, you might want to have a glass of milk, or cup of tea or coffee hanging around, because these ginger snaps really do snap back!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I have never tried any of the  Own products, but had heard the products from this label were of high quality.  I was therefore eager to try  Own Organics Ginger Snaps.  My wife has always loved ginger snaps.  I like them, but have never been overwhelmed by them.  The first thing I liked about the cookie was its size.  Very often, you don't want a regular-size cookie.  The  Own cookies are small -- not quite edible in a single bite.  The size makes it possible to gauge your cookie intake to appetite without waste.The cookies are crisp and literally break off with an audible ""snap.""  They remained crisp and fresh in their bag for well over a week.  The flavor is very ginger-y and leaves a nice tingling aftertaste in your mouth.  My wife was especially pleased at the flavor, since she's a longtime fan of ginger snaps.  I asked her if she'd say the  Own were the best ginger snaps she'd ever tasted.  She pondered a moment or two and then said, ""Yes, definitely.""  High praise indeed.As for myself, I enjoyed the small cookies with coffee after dinner.  They alleviate that sugar craving while not putting on the pounds.  They're a sensible dessert, if eaten in moderation.  These cookies are very fine examples of what a classic ginger snap should be.  The company has concentrated on natural ingredients and care in baking rather than masking the flavor with unnecessary icing or adornment with other toppings."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I favor peanut butter cookies. Perhaps you should consider this as you read this review.As other reviewers have pointed out, these ginger snaps are hard. Perhaps not tooth-cracking hard, but not that far away. Judicious dunking might help.Yet, they are very tasty, you might say ""snappy."" So, we've got hard balanced by tasty."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"For years I have bought and used products from the  Own line, and I have always loved them. So I was very pleased with these wonderful little cookies.Similar to other  products, these are made with organic products (flour and sugar) under the  Organics line and certified by the strict Oregon laws.As for the taste, excellent!!! The ginger is pretty strong in these, which I love. They are a hard, small cookie - perfect for dipping in hot tea. A serving size is 5 cookies with a low calorie count of only 130. There are no trans fats, only 180 mg sodium, and 12 sugars per serving.These make me think of autumn, cool weather, and hot tea. Recently when I had a cold and didn't feel like eating much, these little ginger snaps and hot tea were just the thing to revive my spirits!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Vegan cookies are hard to find.  Tasty vegan cookies are even harder, especially if you are on a budget.  And ginger snaps are available about everywhere but most of them are nothing to write home about.  These ginger snaps are the exception.I am a huge fan of ginger - I love the stuff.  These cookies have plenty of it, not only ground ginger but tiny bits of candied ginger, and that makes a world of difference.  These cookies will bite you back!  Not in a bad way, but in that slightly hot, tickle-your-tongue way that ginger lovers adore.  They are by far the most gingery snaps I've tasted, so if you are not a fan of the spice, they will most likely not appeal to you.  The cookies are quite crunchy and dense, as a good snap should be.  Not too sweet, just a satisfying combination of spicy and sweet.  Add to that organic ingredients and a do-good company, only 130 calories per 5 cookie serving, and it all adds up to a winner.  I love these cookies!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I ordered a pack of these cookies and I am glad I did.  They are great tasting but there were a couple small problems:  The cookies are so hard and thick they are difficult to bite.  Warnings for those with weak teeth.The second warning is a ginger warning.  They are full of ginger and the taste may remain with you for a while.  This didn't matter to me because I love ginger.  But some people may say they have ginger burn.Otherwise the cookies are delicious and I ate them in three sittings."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021," Ginger Snaps with real candied ginger taste great, unlike the national brands sold in stores. The snaps contain no artificial flavors or colors, no hydrogenated oils and no trans-fatty acids. If you're a vegan, these organic cookies are outstanding.  They are dairy and egg free, 130 calories per five (05) snaps. Made with organic flour and sugar!A list of ingredience:* Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour,* Organic Sugar,* Molasses,* Organic Palm Fruit Oil,*  Candied Ginger (Ginger, Sugar),* Ground Ginger,* Salt,* Leavening (Sodium Bicarbonate, Monocalcium Phosphate),* Soy Lecithin,* SpiceThey do contain wheat and soy stuff.  Nutrition Facts are on the package. Great tasting snaps!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"This is a darned nice ginger snap. They're very dry and crisp (for snappiness), and have a good strong ginger flavor -- strong enough to give you a tingle on your tongue if you wolf down a handful of them one after the other, as I'm prone to do. They might be too strongly gingery for some kid's tastes, and better for the cookie-loving grownups in the family."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love ginger snap cookies, and finding good ones is really difficult unless you bake them yourself. I had high hopes for these but my hopes were dashed when I got them and tried them.Right off the bat, I noticed they had a lot of ginger in them....enough to leave a slight tingle on the tongue as an aftertaste. This is great if you love ginger like I do, but could be a problem for some people.I noticed when I opened the bag and grabbed a handful that some of the cookies were too dark and had been over baked. A little darkening on the bottom is fine, but when the sides are starting to get a little burnt and you get a burnt taste, they are overdone and need to be thrown out. Either the ovens need better temperature control, or the inspectors need to be more careful.Finally, I was pleased with the ingredients until I read the list closely. While using organic flour and organic sugar made these seem very healthy, I noticed that the shortening used was palm oil. They used a fancy name for it, but it is basically just palm oil, which is the vegetable oil that is highest in saturated fat content of all the vegetable oils. Why they would use such great organic ingredients and then have an unhealthy fat in them is a mystery to me. It is also a deal breaker.  I guess I go back to baking them for myself....."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These snaps are not too sweet; they have a strong ginger bite (in a good way). They're fairly crisp, but with a little chew to them at the end - almost like they have tiny slivers of candied ginger in them? The molasses taste is there, but it's subtle. I haven't tried this out, but I think they'd also make a good base for a cookie crust. The small size is nice, too - good for a little treat, or a treat for a little one. They're a good contrast to the recipe I use for homemade (which is very molasses-y, and very soft). I'm not over the moon about them, but I do keep eating them...  I wouldn't buy them all the time, but they're a great choice to save time or make a less rich pie crust - and I'm happy to support a company that does a lot of organic products and is conscientious about its use of palm fruit oil (non-hydrogenated, sourced in Columbia where its production supports an indigenous population)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I shared my 6.5 oz bag with the people at the office.  The concenus was that the cookies were very crunchy; some people said that they were too hard.  Also, the ginger flavor was instense, strong enough to leave an aftertaste.  Some of the tasters liked this, some did not.The ingredients are organic, nothing particularly bad for you.  There is palm oil in the mix.  This poses a question.  Where does the palm oil come from?  The Indonesia rain forests are being burnt down to make space for palm oil plantations. Some Girl Scouts have started a drive to boycott cookies make with palm oil since it is difficult to know its origin.On the plus side, the profits of  Own go to worthwhile causes, over $300 million so far, according to their web site.."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022," Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies, 6.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)conjures the taste and smells of grandma's homemade gingersnaps.  Stinging with just the right amount of ginger, these hard little cookies are great with tea, coffee or milk.  That they are organic with unbleached flour and all healthy products fares well for children and adults.  I love that products can be made without additives that are harmful for our bodies without lacking good taste.The packets hold quite a few and would be good to toss into picnic baskets and traveling coolers. Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies, 6.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)should be tried.  Also, remember, that  Own helps support camps for children with cancer and what a genuinely lovely gift that is."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These are some of the tastiest cookies I've had in quite a while.  They are crunchy and have actual bits of ginger in them. Not too sweet, but you still know you are eating something good. There are only 130 calories for five cookies.  They are made with unbleached wheat flour, molasses and ground ginger anong the other ingredients.  They went too fast to see how long they could be stored.  I'll be buying more."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Just received the pack of ginger snaps today. It sure made the sun shine on a rainy day. My wife and I both had two a piece and both stood looking at one another shaking our heads. The ginger taste is wonderful and the only part I did'nt like too well was they are fairly hard, although for me I like softer cookies. I can take good care of that problem with a little dunk in my coffee and then I also have a spiced coffee. All in all a very good taste and a great cookie"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020," Own Organics ginger snaps are a fine addition to the cookie world. They boast candied ginger pieces and the traditional spices that go along with the cookie: cinnamon and cloves. Also, organic sugar and flour have been added to the mix.I haven't had ginger snaps in a while, so when I took my first bite, I was bombarded by the tasty flavor. It was like getting punched in the face! The first few bites were actually a little spicy for me, in a good way. I offered some to a few relatives and they agreed that they were delicious. The texture, however, is hard and a bit grainy. Maybe the organic products come into question?These are still a nice little cookie, and I'll be keeping my eye on them in the market. A good holiday treat!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Ginger Snaps are my hubby's favorite cookie.  He tells me that the flavor was great and had a good after taste.  He did notice that they were beyond crunchy to the point of being hard.  Some also were burned on the bottom like someone failed to take them out of the oven soon enough.This surprises me as the other Newman brand products I have tried were as I expected them to be with no negative points.  Maybe this was a bag that got past the inspection team.If you don't mind the crunchiness and a few darker than normal bottoms, the flavor is great."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm a bit conflicted on these.  These are spicy cookies. A more adult cookie for sure.  Not too sweet, perfect for coffee, milk or tea.  They do have a very ""clean"" taste with nothing really lingering.  They are pretty hard/crispy so you almost need something to dunk them in.  The taste is very good with a slightly chewy gingery inside from the candied ginger.  The only issue I had is a good portion of the cookies were nearly burnt and didn't taste good.  Not to mention they were too hard to consume.  The ones that weren't burnt were very tasty, but the inconsistent quality disappointed me.  It's shame because I did enjoy them and the ingredient list is very nice and wholesome.  Some QC would go a long way in making these better."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm a big fan of all things ginger and like many of Paul  products so I was happy to try out  Own Organic Ginger Snaps. The cookies have a very strong, sharp ginger taste which I liked. However, I found them to be a little too hard and thick, making them crunchy. I like a thinner ginger snap, not one that needs to be dunked in my tea.I'm going to be neutral on these cookies. The taste was great, the texture not so good. I'm not sure if my bag was overcooked or if this is how they were meant to be; they didn't look burned, just a hard cookie. If they change them to be thinner and a bit softer I would definitely buy them as the taste is excellent."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"PROS: intense ginger; delicious with tea, coffee, or especially milk; partially organic (sugar, flour); reasonably low calories--130 per 30-gram serving, = 5 cookies)CONS: not totally organic; contains wheat, soy; rather high fat (30 of 130 calories per serving); no fiber; little protein; rather high sodium; pricey ($3.29 list per 6.5-oz bag)ALTERNATIVE: Trader Joe's Low Fat Ginger Cats Cookies: strong ginger; no soy; fewer calories, less fat (30-gram serving = 120, fat = 15); some fiber; more protein; less sugar; less sodium; much less costly ($2.49 per 16-oz container)"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"If you have an upset stomach then these cookies will fix you up better than ginger ale. I LOVED them! Crunchy and only slightly chewy. The candied ginger in them gives the cookies a serious BITE. My 5 year old son however said, ""Why do these cookies burn my mouth?"" So, they are for a more sophisticated palate. I plan to keep them in the freezer and pop them next time I have an upset stomach."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Ginger SNAP is definitely the right word for these cookies. They are crisp, crunchy, delicious, and a little bit addicting. If crunchy is what you're after, these are the cookies for you.But if you'd rather have a softer ginger cookie, never fear. Just dip these in some hot tea and you've got a softer, chewier cookie that is just as tasty. We've found that we actually prefer the cookies this way.The ginger is fairly powerful and has a bit of ""ginger burn"" to it, but it's by no means overpowering. Our two year-old typically dislikes ginger cookies, but he really liked these. The sugar content is low enough that letting him eat one or two is no big deal.So, if you like ginger cookies, give these a try. We have enjoyed them quite a bit."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"If you really like ginger and you enjoy hard cookies,  Own Organics Ginger Snaps may be for you. The cookies have a very strong, spicy ginger flavor and a long-lasting peppery aftertaste. They're not very sweet, but they're sweet enough. They are very hard and crunchy, with more emphasis on the hard than the crunchy. If you have sensitive teeth, you should exercise caution. I picked up a hint of staleness; the hard-crunchy balance might have fallen on the crunchy side if the cookies had been fresher or had been packaged more quickly after baking. For that reason, I almost gave these a 3-star rating ... but they do taste good."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"A very crunchy cookie, but maybe a little too hard. Nice flavor. Not too sweet. The ginger flavor starts out subtle, but has a very intense aftertaste that is spicy. These are nothing like ginger cookies that don't have real ginger. The candied ginger tends to get stuck in your teeth.An excellent cookie it you like ginger. Stay away if you don't."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These cookies are delicious -- strong ginger and molasses flavor with just enough sugar to make them truly cookies. The ingredient list is heartening -- nine items, all of which I keep in my own pantry. However, they are tooth-breakers. . . so hard that I have to use my molars to bite into them rather than just taking a nibble with my front teeth. I wish they were a bit thinner, which would have made the texture seem merely crispy; at this thickness they're a teensy bit reminiscent of yummy rocks."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love everything ginger so was eager to try these cookies. They have a really rich, almost hot, ginger flavor and you could feel the pieces of candied ginger throughout.  My only complaint is that the texture of the cookie was not at all chewy and in fact was so hard that they were difficult to bite. They have a very rustic look to them and the bottoms of some of the cookies looked almost burnt.  I would buy these cookies again to get the strong ginger flavor -- I just wish the texture were a little softer."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"My grandmother is a sucker for a good gingersnap cookie.  She's very difficult to please.  So I put these cookies to the true test - I handed them over to her.  Nana's assessment is the following.""They were an excellent cookie.  Better than any storebought gingersnap I've had since I was a kid!  They were super crunchy, but not hard to bite.  And the ginger flavor was very strong, which I love.  So many times you get a gingersnap that tastes nothing like ginger and that's very disappointing.  These were nothing like that.  They were delicious!""I sampled some myself and, though I'm not as big a gingersnap fan in general, I have to admit that Nana was spot on in her assessment.  The reason I only awarded 4 stars to these cookies because I do have a minor disclaimer: To me, the ginger flavor was almost TOO strong.  It wasn't at all overpowering.  But it was so strong that it kept growing in the back of my mouth until I felt a tingle in my throat.  I think that might be too much for a lot of people, hence the reason I couldn't in good conscience award full stars.I'd say they were a solid 4 1/2 though.  This is an excellent cookie and definitely better than any other I've ever bought for my family!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021," Ginger Snaps are very crunchy. The first bite was woody but within a few seconds, the ginger taste kicked in. One tiny cookie was enough to wean me off. its almost like having a strong 1/2 cup of ginger tea. Well, then we can use these cookies for relief during a cold. My husband's reaching for a 5th cookie. I dont think it will be a hit with kids. I wonder if light or dark molasses were used."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I'm not a big ginger snap fan to begin with, but I ate half of one of these cookies and threw the rest of the bag away. The ginger taste is sharp and overwhelming, so much so I found it almost made me gag. The cookies are hard as rocks with such an overpowering ginger taste that I can't imagine anyone would like them. I asked my husband to try one, and he actually winced at the first bite. At first he said he would eat them if I wanted him to, but then he admitted he was just trying not to hurt my feelings and agreed we should just toss them out. I normally like  Own products, and I honestly don't know if some ginger snap connoisseurs enjoy such a strong taste of ginger, but I can't recommend these cookies at all."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"If you want a dry and rock-hard cookie that doesn't even remotely taste like real Ginger Snaps this is the cookie for you.  If, on the other hand, you want a gingery, tasty cookie that reminds you of fall AVOID THESE LIKE THE PLAGUE.  Just go to your local supermarket and buy your Ginger Snaps there!  Sorry, Paul, you dropped the ball on this one!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Although I knew that ginger snaps were supposed to be hard, I was surprised by how much so these  Own Organics Ginger Snaps cookies were when I first bit down on one with my front teeth.  It hurt my teeth.  But I quickly adapted by shoving them deep into my cheek and bit down with my molars. I like them.  They have a very strong ginger favor and I am a ginger root lover, and  they are not overly sweet.  I liked them so much that I ate half a bag in one sitting.  There is a burnt favor in the cookies.  I wonder if the bakers had left them in the oven for too long.  They are also the smallest cookies I have ever eaten, measuring only 1-3/4"" across.  They fit my mouth perfectly.  There is a reusable tape on the bag, which can be used to reseal the bag.  It is thoughtful addition.  Overall, these are very delicious and flavorful cookies. I would have given them a 5-star rating, have they not been so hard."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"When I first pulled out one of these little cookies, I was nonplussed. I don't think they're particularly attractive,having an uneven and almost burnt look. But the taste soon convinced me otherwise. These have a very good, very ginger-y and somewhat spicy flavor. I really enjoyed the little bits of ginger that are in each cookie, so that after the cookie is gone there's often a chewy bit of ginger that lingers. Yum. Also, they are smaller, like a silver dollar, and so grabbing a handful of these organic vegan gems does not bring on piles o' guilt. Excellent for gingersnap connoiseurs."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I love the taste of a good ginger snap cookie. When I saw these offered I jumped on them thinking what an easy review this would be. Well.....as for the taste, they are great. True ginger snap flavor!! When I opened the bag, the smell made my mouth water. The cookie itself is extremely hard! I really had a hard time biting into them and chewing them. If the company could ""soften"" them up a bit they would be awesome!! If you like a very hard and crunchy cookie, and love the taste of a ginger snap, you will love this cookie! If you prefer a soft cookie, this one isn't for you!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I found these cookies to be a healthy and tasty snack. Plus, the cookies were crisp, a feature I like. The only negative was that the batch I was given was slightly burnt, downgrading the taste slightly. Hopefully, other batches aren't burnt."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I loved these ginger snap cookies--just the right ginger taste and not too sweet.  However, I have to take one star away for the packaging.  I couldn't get the package open at the top and consequently it ripped down the side.  Here in humid Florida, since I couldn't properly seal the package, the cookies got a little soggy after a few days.  But they were still delicious!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"For those of you used to  a soft, more traditionally spiced & sweetened Ginger Snap, be prepared for a unique, but flavorful experience! If you have trouble chewing hard cookies you should also be forewarned that these are very well-baked cookies and while crisp, they are also a little harder than your typical american cookie - think Biscotti-level-of-crispy/hard and you'll be about right. (As noted further below, you can easily fix this by adding a soft piee of sandwich bread, maybe half a piece to the open bag and then close it tight overnight.  That will soften the cookies up nicely)  That said, these are an interesting treat that are sure to clear your sinuses and your palate!  The Ginger taste is normal with the first nibble but by the end of the half-dollar sized cookie, you are breathing ginger fire! it's not a turly ""hot"" spiciness but it IS strong and did make my nose run a little after two cookies.  I enjoyed the crispiness and the intensity cuz I like Ginger, so that's not a bad thing.  Own ups the Ginger quotient by adding not just ground Ginger but Candied Ginger Root , which has a powerful ginger flavor.  It's sold in most Asian sections of the grocery store as Ting Ting Jahe and I love it for it's intense ginger flavor, so adding it as an ingredient made sense to me.  I was mildly disappointed that they omitted the normal small amount of pepper from the recipe but that's a more european tradition.  Consider this a very Asian version of the Ginger Snap or just a more adult treat. These cookies are only lightly sweetened, so you can enjoy the recommended serving of 5 of the 1.5 inch diameter cookies (think of a Kennedy Half Dollar coin) and come away having only eaten 130 calories. Personally, I was satisfied with just 2 of the small cookies at a time due to the strong flavor.  That will sure help my wasitline! If you do eat the 5 cookies as a serving, you will be getting 24 carbs but only 12 of them are from sugar, which beats out most crispy cookies in that regard. The rest of the carbs are from the unbleached wheat flour and other ingredients.  Only 30 of the 130 calories per serving come from Fat. That's better than the average cookie and almost certainly much better than most of the ""100 calorie"" packages of sweets and cookies.  They've made a concerted attempt to balance the sugar and fat content with other ingredients to produce a tasty treat but not one that you'll feel bad about havinbg eaten after the fact.  Overall, once the bag was finished, I'd say nobody in the house ever ate the full suggested serving in one sitting - usually 2 to 3 cookies satisfied our  ""little something indulgent"" craving.At first I wasn't too pleased to see Palm fruit oil as the fat chosen for this product because it's a saturated fat and one often sourced from slash & burn agriculture... BUT...  Own uses an Organic Palm Fruit Oil and most Organic Palm oil is made from Palm Kernels, which has even more fat.   Own uses oil that is harvested from farms that make a strong effort to preserve local wildlife so it's not like the companies that are Green ""in name only""  but whothen go and use Palm oil from Indonesian clear-cut plantations.   Own has a solid reputation to protect and I doubt they'd risk it by using a non-green source of Palm Oil. I trust that they've sourced this from the greenest farms they can find since their price point is higher.  Just to be sure I wasn't steering any consumer wrong,  I looked this issue up on the  Own website FAQ for this product & they explain that they use Palm Fruit oil  which is a better saturated fat than  the food industry standards of Palm Kernel oil or Coconut Oil.  They further explain that they use this oil both for the lower price and the better taste & texture they provide the finished baked good. The  Own FAQ also specifically states that their source is a Green Co-Op in Columbia that is Certified Organic.  That made me feel a lot better since Palm oil Plantations in Indonesia are causing the extinction of Orangatans and dozens of other species at an alarming rate.  I feel good knowing that  Own cares about the same things I do!The price of this treat seems to bother a lot of people and I feel I should address that.  For me, I buy  Own products specifically because I can trust their ingredient sourcing and I don't mind paying a premium price since I know that the profits help fund charitable grants.  Also on  Own Website, they explain that the recent huge increases in Organic food ingredients has impacted their prices and that they have tried to deal with that as best as they can.  You can also go to their site and print coupons for use in your local grocery store and they do frequently run grocery specials here on Amazon.  With these Ginger Snaps, I suspect a smaller amount will satisfy any snack craving I might have since they are so intensely flavored and baked to such a crisp.  Therefore, I'm not too concerned about mindlessly eating myself out of house and home.  Snack foods and sweets are indulgences and if you want the best ingredients with regard to taste, health, and environmental impact, sometimes you have to pay a little more.  Since I've not had the whole bag, I can tell you that my instincts proved correct and that nobody in the house ever ate more than 2 to 3 cookies for a snack.  They filled the ""Snack"" spot in our menu and did it with fewer calories and about the same cost overall (if I had not gotten the bag for free) as other treats we like that are cheaper.  I will buy these in the store or on Amazon but as usual, I will shop for sales and look at the  Own site for Coupons!Overall, I would say this is a bracingly intense Ginger Snap with a whole lotta crunch!  The serving size is satisfying and the caloric content is well-balanced  in regard to fat and sugar content.  If you find the very firm texture of the cookie to be a bit much, I would suggest opening the packet and putting in half a slice of fresh bread and then re-sealing the bag well.  Within a day, the cookies should soften up a bit by absorbing the moisture from the bread.  Try it!  It might just make these a 5 star experience for you.I took one star off because in all honesty, they aren't the best Ginger Snaps I've ever had and the powerful Ginger taste reminded me a bit too much of eating Ginger Udon Noodles for dinner. These are not a treat for people who crave something truly sweet.  My wife suggested that brushed the cookies with a little water and then sprinkling some brown sugar on top or even dusting them with powdered sugar before serving might help but I ate them without trying to sweeten them up.  I did, however, like them softened up after she tried the bread slice trick on the latter half of the bag! Even so, 4 stars is a great rating and if you love Ginger, you'll love these.  If you regularly chew the Ginger candy I mentioned above, Tin Ting Jahe, then this will be a 5 star experience for you!  ALso, to acknowledge the price, I felt I couldn't give this five total stars since some people reading this are not in a position to care about ethical ingredient sourcing and so forth; they just want to be able to afford a bag of cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Once I get past the concept of ""organic cookies"", which sounds like an oxymoron, I have to admit: these ginger snaps are not for wussies.  These little gems are really concentrated with ginger flavor; one might even say they're downright spicy.  The little bits of candied ginger are no small part of this potent taste.  They really impress as an old-fashioned style cookie, and remind me a bit of the British ""Ginger Nuts"".  As cookies go, they're not bad in the fat department either, with 130 calories per serving, 30 from fat.  If you like your ginger flavor strong, these are the cookies for you."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"There are no substitutes for quality fresh ingredients.  Ginger snaps are one of my favorites and these are as good as any homemade cookie recipes I have tried.  I do prefer a bit more spice than these provide but the fresh flavors more than compensate."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Amazon Vine sent me a bag of these in the mail, and I just got them, and they are delicious! Not quite as hot as some other ginger snaps, but very tasty. I like the package, too. It has an easy open seam with an adhesive strip to re-close it. Very efficient. Excellent cookies. I will totally buy more of these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021," Own Organic Ginger Snaps are loaded with ginger.  Both candied and ground ginger give these small hard cookies a real kick.  Taste is a mixture of wheat flower, sugar and molasses.  The ginger kick arrives late and mostly as an after taste.  For someone who likes ginger, this is a good thing.  Children may find this too overpowering and not care for these.  Nice to have on hand for a late night snack with a cold glass of milk for dunking."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm a fan of ginger snaps and cookies. I can't have dairy, so I give a thumbs up to  for making them vegan.I always think twice about ordering food through the mail since fragility often leads to damages. Mine arrived in great condition and the bag and snaps weren't crushed. These are fairly-priced too, which is a great deal for organic food. Sometimes organic stuff is just ""too rich for my blood,"" but not in this case. I'm giving you the green light to order!The serving size is five snaps, but let's be honest - these are delicious and we're going to eat more than five. They have a bit of a ""bite"" to the flavor, a real ginger spiciness, which is nice. I'd compare them to Swedish-style <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPP588"">Mi-Del's Ginger Snaps</a>, a personal favorite."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I don't generally choose ginger snaps over other kinds of cookies, but I do enjoy them from time to time.  These cookies can't pass for homemade, but they're certainly more interesting than I expected from a bagged cookie.  The texture is a little off-putting; these cookies are definitely crunchy, and that's not as positive a quality when they're so thick.  I think future tweaking of this product ought to include making them either a little thinner or a little softer.  Aside from texture, though, they're definitely tasty.  There's a little sweetness, but the dominant taste comes from the bite of plenty of ginger.  It's a much bolder spice than I anticipated, and I was pleasantly surprised.I can definitely see myself buying these cookies again in the future - not so much just for myself, but as a last-minute contribution for a holiday party this winter."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"""Try this, GMR,"" I said, and gave him a  Own Ginger Snap.*crunch crunch crunch* Mmmmmmmm, says he.""It's a vegan ginger snap!"" I say, and grin around the room as if I had made them my own se'f.I pass them around our comp'ny here in the cove at Killian Knob and everyone takes a cookie and the entire room, the cove, the universe is filled with the sounds of *CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH!* - for these are some crunchy cookies and in fact, if they were just one more teeniensy bit of crunchy, they'd be too hard. But good ole Newman knew his crunch factor so danged if he didn't leave it just as it should be.All agreed that lil ole cookie packed a wallop of good ginger taste. What I liked most was that it wasn't overly sweet - thankee Newman, for not sending me into a sugar jitter as some cookie makers do!They're tiny, too, which means we could eat the entire bag and not realize it, save for how crunchy they are - slows down the jawing - haw! - so that we only ate a few. Bet they'd be good dipped in milk, if you like milk that is - if you don't, and sometimes I do and sometimes I don't, then well, it probably would taste nasty, so don't try it on the days you hate milk, especially if that's every day - right? Huhn.So, as I said ""It's a vegan ginger snap!"" and everyone snapily crunched, no one thought ""Ewwww,"" - oh no, nopity no. Everyone happily crunchified their way to gingersnap heaven. Only one person said, ""Aren't all cookies vegan?"" and I shrugged and ate another cookie, for I really couldn't remember if there were any lard cookies out there or chicken cookies or liver cookies. . . then I remembered vegans don't eat eggs or milk (guess can't dip it in milk after all - well dang!), and I said, ""Nope, all cookies are not vegan,"" with an air of Great Knowledge.And that, my friends, concludes my review of this little cookie. namaste."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"There is plenty of ginger in these ginger snaps, so fans of strong ginger taste should love these cookies.  The ginger is so strong it leaves a burning sensation on the tongue.  These are small, rather hard cookies with all organic ingredients and 130 calories from five cookies.  These would probably go down better with a hot beverage or a cold glass of milk. The bag is resealable to maintain freshness."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Ginger is one of my least favorite spices; and I have never cared much for ginger bread cookies or ginger snaps. I must say, however, that these from the Newman family are quite tasty little surprises. Supposedly these ginger snaps are made from real candied ginger, and it shows. The ginger flavor is quite strong. I may have to rethink my position on ginger. If I can hold off, I plan to put these cookies in the crust of a a pumpkin cheesecake for the holidays.This product is also dairy and egg free if case you care. I don't. I have been eating them with fat free milk. Everything in life is a tradeoff anyway."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Warning do not set this bag of Ginger Snaps by your computer.  If you fail to follow this advice you are likely to eat the whole bag without realizing it.My brother, after tasting these Ginger Snaps commented ""these should be labeled dangerously delicious.""  Why? They are not dangerous because of the ingredients, they are made with 70%+ organic ingredients.  They are dangerous because they are so tasty that it is easy to over do it and eat the whole bag!If you like Ginger Snaps you owe it to your taste-buds to try a bag of  Organic Ginger Snaps.P.S.  Ginger Snaps are one of my favorite cookies so I might be slightly biased."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I received  Own Organics Ginger Snaps today.  They were delivered by the U.S. Mail and they are so hard, that even the mail carrier did not crush them when they were stuffed in my mail box.  I did not expect the cookie to be so hard and have a burnt appearance.I really wanted to like these cookies because I do try to buy organic products when I can.  However, these cookies had a strange flavor that lingered long after I finished one.  The ginger is just overpowering.  My tongue is still tingling a bit.  Maybe it is just me because other reviewers have given this cookie high ratings.I think that  Own Organics makes some wonderful items, but this is not one of them.  I will buy Nabisco Ginger Snaps next time."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I think these might be the best-tasting store-bought ginger snaps I've ever encountered.They're VERY crisp.  The ginger flavor is bracingly fresh and clean, without that annoying ""bite"" -- that cloying aftertaste -- that most other ginger snaps have.And there is a little bit more grit to the texture than with other store-bought ginger snaps.I also like a neat little feature on the packaging -- a peel-and-stick strip of tape you can use to reseal the package after you munch a bunch of cookies, to keep the remaining snaps snappy.Looking at the list of ingredients, I see that most appear to be the product of Mother Nature, not laboratory science.At a little under $3 for a 6-1/2-ounce package, these classy cookies seem to be not too unreasonably priced, a rarity these days.So if you're looking for a superior ginger snap on the cookie shelf of your favorite supermarket, I suggest you give these a try.  I give them thumbs up -- with a snap!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"This cookies have a great bite to them - the perfect gingersnap! The ginger tastes fresh - like it's just been peeled! They're crispy without being rock hard as some bagged cookies tend to be. Even more impressive than the taste is the short ingredient list - no fillers, fake colors/ flavors, or nasty preservatives. They have a good fat- to- total calorie ratio, so I'd be comfortable keeping them around as a quick snack, and the peel-off sticker for resealing will help them good on the road. I'd definitely recommend these to anyone who likes ginger!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I personally didnt like these ginger snaps at all; and only 1 person in my family of 4 liked these and that was my wife. These are not cookies that kids or teens will like. These are an acquired taste and few will enjoy them so not good guest treats either.They were incredibly harder and spicier than regular ginger snaps as well in my opinion. If you dont like hard or spicy cookies then this is definitely not recommended."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Woohoo! These ginger snaps are the genuine article. (Mama says they're bonafide!) They pack a punch and a crunch. Most of the bottoms are at least a little blackened, which I think is fine. They've got a nice spice to them, perhaps not for the faint of heart. A word of advice: you may be tempted to attach the package to your face like a feedbag, but eating too many of these potent cookies in one sitting could make your tummy angry."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I really love these cookies, which shocked me because I haven't liked most ginger cookies I've tried in my life. These are fresh and crisp. They taste like ginger and the flavor really lasts on the pallet.  They are a bit dry, kind of like biscotti and so they are a great treat to accompany a hot drink.These arrived when I had a stomach bug and they were one of the few things I could get down. I will likely keep these on hand for when I have an upset stomach. They really helped."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Maybe I need to get out more... I have never eaten ginger snaps like these. They are really crunchy (hard as a rock, to be completely blunt)... and full of bits of crystallized ginger - which give them such a strong and peppery flavor it brought tears to my eyes.If you are disappointed by store bought cookies that are wimpy and not flavorful enough, then these are the cookies for you. I think I'll just stick with my favorites -  plain boring old snickerdoodles."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"This is a delightful treat that was better than I expected it to be.  I shared a bag with friends and they were unanimous in their approval.  The cookies were crisp and delicious.  Heartily recommended."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are so good.  They are sweet and delicious but also have a little touch of heat.  Not too much though, even my kids liked them.  They are crunchy and chewy.  Because the cookies are organic, the ingredient list is short and the cookies taste like home baked.  If you like ginger snaps, you will love these."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"My wife got me a bag of these cookies and I thought they were great. Expect heat from these. They are not ""kiddie cookies"". Very strong spicy ginger taste. They were also very hard, and that's the only fault I had with them. I know they are ginger snaps, but I was worried about my teeth being the ""snap"". Left the bag open for a bit and they softened up to an acceptable level. All in all an excellent cookie!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I loved these cookies.  Incredibly crunchy.  Several layers of ginger flavor, including candied ginger bits.  These are the closest you will get to a real ginger snap that isn't homemade by your grandma.  If you have dental problems, you might not want to try them because they are just that crunchy.  But I liked the crunch.  My little kids, ages 3 and 8, initially really liked them too, but after 3-4 cookies, they were complaining of the spiciness.  That is a plus in my book--don't have to worry about my kids eating all the cookies before I even get one!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These are wonderful. They have just enough ginger in them to have a zing, but overly so. My bag came with two types of cookies: crunchy ginger snaps and chewy ones. I actually prefer the chewy ginger cookies as opposed to the traditional crunchy snaps! I'm not sure if this was intentional or not, but  Own should offer both a crunchy ginger snap and a chewy one. I get migraines from MSG and flavor enhancers, so I have to only eat organic products. (Items label ""Natural"" often have some type of MSG-derived product in them.)These are a tasty treat--perfect for Fall! Yum!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I have always felt the  Own brand had integrity for purity of ingredients. They have declined! I couldn't even eat this product because after I bought it, I found an ingredient that causes me great gastro-intestinal pain - ""Spice"".  Spice is code for MSG, Monosodium Glutamate, a potentially harmful ingredient if ingested.  I am sure that the cookies, just like all of  products I've ever tasted, are delicious. Unfortunately, I can't eat them. Thumbs down  for using this harmful chemical in your product."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I am particular about ginger snaps and have a select few that I really enjoy. I have now found the one that has become my absolute favorite.  Own Organic Ginger Snaps have everything that I look for in a ginger cookie.These are spicy, but with a pleasant bite, and a buttery finish. They are crispy but not rock-hard. The are organic (always my preference) and come from a thoughtful company who donates their proceeds (another nice touch).I haven't been disappointed by a  product yet, and this is no exception. Absolutely give these a try!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021," Own Organics (co-founded by Nell Newman) started as a subsidiary of  Own in 1992 and became a separate company in 2001.Fans of NOO begged for a ginger snap cookie to be added to the line and they got their wish.These ginger snaps are made with ground ginger and candied ginger. There is a double ginger bite and kick to these cookies.These organic snaps are addictive and it is easy to eat the whole bag in one sitting. Separate five cookies each into six bags and you will stick to eating 130 calories for a snack instead of the entire bag.Fun Fact: The American Gothic picture on the package features ""Pa"" (Paul) Newman and daughter Nell Newman in appropriate costume."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020," ginger snaps are exactly that - small, very crisp cookies with a strong ginger taste.  I'm  a habitual label reader and I was also pleased to see that they weren't made with a long batch of esoteric chemicals - only recognizable natural ingredients. The package also comes with a convenient peel tape for re-sealing after its initial use.  Why three stars?  I personally found the ginger taste a bit strong for my palate, and the cookies a bit hard.  But if you like a pronounced ginger flavor in a crunchy cookie, these ginger snaps are for you."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"This bag of cookies didn't survive more than an hour in my house which pretty much sums up how good they are.Above all, check this out in the description: ""All natural; made with 70%+ organic ingredients; no artificial flavors or colors; no hydrogenated oils; no trans-fatty acids; dairy free; egg free; vegan"". We're currently doing the vegan thing so it's great to find tasty snacks like this that make you forget about oils, butters and the things you're giving up.I'm a huge fan of ginger so it's simply not possible to have too much in my opinion. I loved the crunchiness and appropriate bite size as well. I'll be ordering more now that the freebies have gone."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Like Paul Newman himself, these cookies are tough and gingery. I gave it 3 stars because some people will like the snap to one's teeth as one bites down, and also will like the lingering hot ginger taste after one has swallowed. I didn't. In fact, the ginger buildup in my mouth was so intense after only two cookies that I stopped eating them.I thought the taste was adequate with a good sugar content. Frankly, I would have preferred less ginger and a softer cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These are very very hard cookies, I had a difficult time biting into them. Once I soaked them in milk they were much better. The spice is just right, they had a good flavor. Just over half of the package of cookies were too done on the bottom, that does not say much about their quality control. I do like that they are organic, it is hard to find sweet treats that are, so I did give them a three out of five."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are crunchy, though they have bits of ginger in them which are a bit chewy. The cookies are relatively thick and hold up well when dipping in milk but not as well in hot tea (quick dip otherwise they get mushy and fall apart)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These are very, very crisp cookies.  So if you like a softer cookie, you may not want to buy these.  They do taste good, though, especially with coffee.  However, I did notice that after eating 3 or 4 of them, there was definite heat from all the ginger.  These are fairly healthy cookies, made with mostly organic ingredients.  They weren't the best ginger cookies I have ever eaten, but they were an enjoyable snack."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love cookies and I love  Own products, so when I saw that  Own were coming out with Organic Ginger Snap cookies, I had to try them. Made with Organic Flour and Sugar, these Ginger Snaps are form the  Own Organics line, run by Paul  daughter, Nell. Now I have to say these cookies pack a powerful punch of flavor. If you don't like your ginger snaps to be too spicy, I would steer clear of them. They are very crunchy and tasty,but I had to have a tall glass of iced tea by my side when eating them because they really have a load of ginger in them. They are a great bite size and have real candied ginger bits in them. Even though they are a bit spicier than I generally like, I still polished off the bag quite quickly! I am looking forward to trying more from the Organic line of  products."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I am fond of ginger. I use fresh ginger root and ground ginger in many recipes, especially stir-fries. It's aromatic, flavorful and has some spice heat.You can really taste the ginger in these  Own cookies, but I just didn't care for it that much. They don't skimp, I'll give them that much. My feeling, though, is that it needs to be toned down a bit for use in cookies. It's a little too prominent here.Also, there was a very definite bitter under-taste here that I don't think comes from the ginger. I think they may have been somewhat over baked."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love ginger snaps and never pass up an opportunity to sample something different.  These are bite sized, crunchy cookies with a distinct but not overwhelming bite to them.  Egg and dairy free, they can be enjoyed by Vegans or people with allergies.  By purchasing  Own products, you are also helping fund programming that supports the common good. The price is comparable to similar products and it makes sense to purchase from a company that can see beyond its bottom line."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"If I'm one thing, I'm a cookie guy. I even started my own website for Cookie Athletes. Normally I'm a chocolate cookie guy but I'm an equal opportunity eater. So when I tried these ginger snaps, they quickly became my favorite ginger snap cookie. Not only does the organic aspect appeal to me but so does  commitment to giving back.I think the thing that really makes it for me is the candied gingers in the cookie. It adds just a little bit more texture and ""umph"" to the cookie and really solidifies it as a great cookie. If you like the texture of dried fruit in food, then this tiny piece of candied ginger make it perfect.The only con is that sodium is a bit high at 180MG, but hey, it's a cookie!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"My husband and I thought these were the best ginger snaps ever.  Unlike the Keebler kind, these are thick and crunchy, without breaking your teeth.  The ginger burns in your throat for about a minute after eating them and it's a powerful flavor.  It's nice to have a cookie that actually fills your mouth with taste, instead of just sweetness.  I like the tape on the bag that lets you seal it up after eating.  The zipper type bags sometimes just don't seal right or tear.  This is definitely a delicious treat."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I buy the Mi-Del All Natural Ginger Snaps as a treat for myself sometimes. These are very similar, but, amazingly, even better. It's all about the candied ginger.Candied ginger. Like, little spicy sweet bits of ginger in the very gingery cookies. Yum yum yum.These are HARD. SNAPPY. Like ginger snaps should be. And they're GINGERY. SNAPPY. Like ginger snaps should be.If you don't like ginger snaps, well, don't buy these. Otherwise, YUM."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"I like a ginger snap that lives up to its name, and these sure do.  Own is a big name, but has a more humble quality, like homemade or something you would get from a bakery. They're full of ginger punch, which I love. The spiciness really lays heavy on the pallet, and the cookies have a lot of good texture. These are perfect for a pie crust and the fact that they are made from real food and not a bunch of additives makes them less a guilty pleasure and more a wholesome treat. Give me a plate of these with a glass of milk, and I'll be happy."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"Not being a food critic, I can't give this product the detailed description it surely deserves.If you like ginger snaps, you're bound to like these. They're a good consistency (not too desert dry or rock hard), not as large as many grocery store cookies (doubtless part of the reason for good calorie numbers).Being from  Own, they're organic and go in part to a good cause.I recommend these highly....."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020," Own Organics Ginger Snaps, ginger cookies, are a great treat.  The cookies are small but bursting with ginger flavor.  They are firm and satisfying for snacking.  A great boon is that you get five cookies for only 130 calories, so these cookies can fit into anyone's diet as a great tasting snack.  The fact that these cookies are organic are just another plus.  But, of course, the taste is the key criteria and these are so tasty that they will quickly become a family favorite!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I grew up loving Ginger snaps, so I jumped at the task of evaluating  Own Organics Ginger snaps. First: the texture of the cookies is robust but not overwhelming. The taste is strong but not unpleasant. I haven't yet seen these cookies in the store but will be buying them as soon as they appear in our local supermarkets.  own uses organic wheat flour. This helps to make the product both robust and flavorful. When you see these Ginger snaps, don't pass up an opportunity to enjoy them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I am sad to be giving this a lackluster review, because I truly love Paul Newman,  Own, and what they stand for. It's for that reason that I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1. These cookies were hard. I realize ginger snaps are supposed to be hard, but these are break-your-teeth-out kind of hard. Not to mention, they were extremely well done... which is a nice way of saying they were burnt. But like I said, I usually love  Own, and I strongly recommend their delicious pizzas!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"The ginger flavor of these cookies is intense!  Because the flavor is so strong, the serving size (5) is actually enough to satisfy.  Another great thing about the ginger snaps is the short ingredient list.  The cookies are a little hard, but nothing that a glass of milk can't solve."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The only reason that I give this 4 stars and not 5 is personal preference, I like soft cookies, and maybe a bit bigger than these which are a silver dollar size. But dipped in something hot, these cookies are amazing! YUM! I can even chew little pieces of ginger in them.  My mouth is rather alive at the moment, sort of like eating a piece of real ginger or candied ginger. I can see that there's a limit to how much I want to eat, but I like ginger and well, they don't skimp on flavor!  I have to say that really, on a cold night with a hot drink... these are addicting!Okay... I need to put them down now.... yes... that's what I'll do, but maybe have one more first..."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Hooray for a lack of uniformity!Every cookie in this bag is a slightly different size, shape, crispness and thickness. Each bite is a unique experience, just as if you are eating home baked cookies. Some are a little softer, others are pure snap. The one constant is the taste, which is that of a true gingersnap; strong, bracing, not too sweet but absolutely sweet enough.If you're a gingersnap fan, you will love them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are hard little cookies, but with good taste. Has a great ginger taste, I like the flavor. The cookie is a bit smaller in size than an oreo cookie. It is hard to bite into with front teeth because the cookie is so hard, but it is small enough to pop the entire cookie into your mouth and enjoy. Gives you a nice spice aftertaste. It was actually kind of hard for me to eat just one, I like the flavor. For some reason these cookies kind of remind me of Mother's brand cookies.The bag is easy to open and there is a reseal tab attached to keep the freshness of the cookies. Nutrition Facts says the serving size is 5 cookies (30g) and 130 calories per serving."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Really tasty little cookies.  The bad thing about these yummy treats is that the bag should've been bigger.  Not that my waist line is complaining, but my taste buds and tummy sure are....more they cry out...more..."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"Strong ginger flavor, with residual heat, which is normal for real ginger; I see they're made with candied ginger and ground ginger, plus some organic ingredients.  This batch seemed well done; I don't know if they're supposed to be that dark--and a trifle black on the bottom of some.  They're smaller and thicker than what I'm used to--and hard and crunchy.  You definitely need to soak them in milk longer, but yes, I really like them.  One family member thought some cookies were burned, but she loves them and plans to buy more.  We both noticed pieces of candied ginger, which we all love.  Another family member doesn't think they need to be dunked in milk.  The best thing about them is that they truly are ginger snaps."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"There is no question that  Own has made some really outrageous and clever cusisine, but it has been benefiting so many people for years. But when I heard about their cookies, I was absolutely very skeptical about them. Their Family Recipe Ginger Snaps, really bring out the ginger of the gingersnap cookies. Each cookie, really tastes like you smelling a freshly minced piece from ginger root. It is that strong, in fact a bit too strong for kids, but not for adults. They do taste good, but I do think kids might be a bit turned off with the cookies though because of the strong ginger root smell and taste. Still,  Own does really make it worth its while, and I do recommend you give  Own Organics Ginger Snaps a try.Price: BTaste: B+Overall: B+"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I love ginger snaps, so I'm always willing to try a new brand.  I traditionally like the Nabisco ginger snaps and those are my brand of choice, so that's the baseline to compare these to in my mind.These cookies are smaller, about the size a a half dollar coin.  They are very crispy and have a good flavor.  They seemed to be almost over baked as they were very dark brown on the bottom of the cookie (though they did not tast burnt).  The ginger taste is a bit stronger than Nabisco snaps, and they are slightly less sweet.  There seems to be a bit less molasses flavor as well.  I did notice a slight aftertaste with these cookies that I don't get from Nabisco cookies.  I probably atribute that to the stronger ginger flavor, so if you're a bit fan of ginger, you might like these a little more than I did.  I shared these cookies with several co-workers and most of them gave a thumbs up, although a couple people did comment that they did notice the aftertaste.Organic is always nice, but in a cookie, I'm probably less apt to buy these just because they are made from organic ingredients."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022," Family Recipe Ginger Snap Cookies have a strong but pleasant ginger flavor, with molasses and other spices adding to the taste.  These cookies are about the size of Nilla Wafers, and a serving is considered five with 130 calories total.  They have a crunchy texture and aren't messy if you want to grab a handful to eat on the go.  They are also vegan and made with all-natural products.Just noticed while examining the package that it comes with pull off tape which lets you reseal the package. A nice touch, if you ask me.I did get a couple which had a dark brown/blackish bottom, but those were exceptions, and overall, they were tasty with no unpleasant aftertaste.  If you want to be more decadent, try putting a small scoop of French vanilla ice cream between two for a homemade ice-cream sandwich."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"""The Second Generation"" of  Own Organics has made ""Family Recipe Cookies."" The variety I sampled is the Ginger Snap, ""made with organic flour and organic sugar.""The cookies are on the small side, about 2"" across. They are crunchy, with a savory bite to them. There is a deep spice flavor that leaves a lingering zing on your palate. If you prefer your sweets to be more savory than sweet, you'll really enjoy these cookies.There are five cookies per serving. At 130 calories and 3.5 grams of fat, they are a good choice for your healthy lifestyle.While not all of the ingredients were organic, such as the Molasses and spices, the majority ingredients were organic.These are good ""grown up"" cookies. My children did not like them because of the savory side of the spices.I would purchase them again for myself."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Delicious bite-sized cookie from  Own Organics is a 'party in your mouth'!!  The ginger cookie will melt on your tongue releasing wonderous flavor of mouth watering goodness.  If you prefer, you can crunch the cookie between your teeth or dip in a glass of milk...whichever way you choose to partake this is a special cookie that will have you reaching for more on your grocer's shelf.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TPKAN4""> Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies, 6.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Woooo these are addictive.  I think it's the power combo of spicy ginger, sugar, a bit of pronounced saltiness and crunch.  They are about an inch in diameter and pack a real subtly-heated punch of authentic ginger flavor.  I love ginger any way I can get it; pickled, candied, fresh in sweets and savories, you name it.  It says they have candied ginger pieces in them but after popping about ten of these I have only encountered one chewy morsel.  They are organic and all natural, so that might account for the inconsistency in texture.  Some were exactly like a puffy, hard-crunch biscotti and others were flatter, denser and slightly chewy with crunch around the edges.  But all of them were extremely delicious when dipped in coffee.  They're okay alone, but the coffee dipping made them truly awesome.  Really yummy and great for Fall and holiday time.  I bet you could blend them up nicely with butter like you would for a graham cracker crust for pies or cheesecake.  2 cents.Ingredients: Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic sugar, molasses, organic palm fruit oil, candied ginger, ground ginger, salt, leavening(sodium bicarbonate, monoccalcium phosphate), soy lecithin, spice.Serving size 5 cookies130 caloriesTotal fat 3.5 gSaturated fat 1.5 gSodium 180 mgTotal carb 24 gFiber 0Sugars 12 gProtein 1 g"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"At the end of the day I am a fan of the flavor that is ""ginger"".  Ginger has a taste that is both smooth yet has a zing, which makes it very versatile for food.  It has found a home in the realm of Asian cuisine, the ginger man cookie would be lost without it and nothing says ""adult soda"" like a glass of ginger ale.  And this is only the beginning of what you can do with ginger (root).  Yet it must be remembered that a little can go a long way.This brings us to this ""ginger snap"" cookie by "" Own"".  In a word I would have to describe this cookie as ""awful"".  It is too gingery, to the point that my mouth feels like I just ate too much hot sauce once the cookie is chewed and swallowed, in other words bad after taste. The cookie has no balance in flavor; it is just straight up ginger, a sweet aspect would be nice. If I wanted to experience that much ginger I would just chew on ginger root. The cookie itself is as hard as a rock.  I was actually concerned I might chip my teeth when biting into this cookie and this is no hyperbole.  Not to mention that the back of almost every cookie in the bag were burnt.The bag itself is very small and the cost is rather high for what the product really is.  This cookie is also made with organic ingredients.  The one category of food marketing that fails to impress me is organic foods.  For the most part they aren't any healthier and are way too expensive.  So at the end of the day I would suggest on passing on this cookie and go for an old school Pepperidge Farm ginger man cookie."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I LOVE ginger snaps, and we are fans of  Own products in this household, but thumbs down on this one.  First of all, they were very hard and over-baked.  In fact, our bag had several with almost burnt bottoms on the cookies.  We found we could tolerate them better if we dunked them in cold milk first, then they weren't so hard, but it still left a funny aftertaste.  They are very strong with ginger and some other spice we couldn't identify but didn't like. I've never met a ginger-snap I didn't like...until now :("
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I generally like all of  Own food products, particularly their salad dressings, so was surprised to find these ginger snaps completely inedible. It doesn't matter how healthy a snack might or might not be - if it doesn't taste good, the healthy question is a moot point. And  Own simply got something wrong with this recipe because these little cookies are just no good. I let various members of my family try them just to make sure it wasn't just me who found them tasteless, and there was a unanimous thumbs down. I'll go for other brands of ginger snaps and stick with salad dressing, pasta sauces and such from ."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I wish I could give these cookies a great review.  However, I can't. At first taste, they remind me of regular ginger snaps. However, after the second bite, I found the ginger to be so overwhelming that it's almost hot. The aftertaste lasted so long in my mouth that I couldn't get rid of it even after eating something else. I appreciate that they are organic, but I did not find them at all appealing and could not even finish the first cookie.Ellen Gable HrkachAuthor, Stealing Jenny"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"We loved this cookies. I was surprised at how much ""gingery"" the cookies taste. Also they were very crunchy which made it a very satisfying cookie.My husband loves to have cookies with his afternoon coffee. He tried the ginger snap cookies and absolutely fell in love with them. I had to take the package out of his hands or he would have eaten the entire bag in one sitting!The package includes a little tape to close the bag. Very useful if you do not eat the entire bag in one sitting.The list of ingredients are: Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Molasses, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Candied Ginger (Ginger, Sugar), Ground Ginger, Salt, Leavening (Sodium Bicarbonate, Mono-calcium Phosphate), Soy Lecithin, Spice. I can pronounce all those ingredients so the claim of organic holds.I highly recommend this cookies for those who like ginger snap cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are the best ginger snaps I have ever tasted. The ginger taste is intense but not over-powering. I like that they added little pieces of candied ginger to the cookie. It's a nice touch. I appreciate that the ingredients are ones I can actually pronounce. There are no ingredients in this cookie that make me wonder what I am eating. These are all ingredients that one would use baking cookies in their own home. The cookies are approximately 1 and 1/2 inch in size and there are approximately 30 cookies in the 6.5 ounce bag. The bag comes with a resealable tape so you can close the bag up tight to preserve the freshness and snap of these delightful little cookies. The cookies are very crunchy but not break your teeth hard like some ginger snaps can be. They have the perfect density for a ginger snap. I highly recommend these ginger snaps and I myself will be buying more of them."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"If you like ginger, you will more than likely appreciate these ginger snaps from  Own Organics.  Unlike many ginger snaps or other ginger-containing products, you not only taste the ginger in these cookies, but you can feel it, too.  Here are the particulars of my review:Pros:*  Real ginger taste - Even after just one cookie, I had that telltale spicy burn in my mouth unique to ginger.  In addition to ground ginger, these cookies contain bits of candied ginger large enough to chew on.  If you really love ginger, you'll probably like these cookies.  For those of you who are sensitive to the spice, these may be too much in my opinion.*  Thick size - While not terribly large, about 1.5 inches across, these are fairly thick - about 1/4 inch.  That makes them thicker than most ginger snaps I've run across and also satisfying to eat.  You don't feel cheated by having just one.*  Ingredients - These are mostly made up of ingredients listed as organic on the label, though not all the ingredients are organic.Cons:*  Palm oil - For those seeking to avoid this particular ingredient, this may be a drawback.  Saturated fat comes in at 1.5g and even though the palm fruit oil is listed as organic, it is the type of fat that may turn some people away.*  Crunch - For this reviewer, these were a little too crunchy - even to the point of being jarring.  I was surprised initially and it reminded me of eating especially hard Corn Nuts or un-popped popcorn.  Maybe it is because they are so thick, or perhaps because they have been baked a little longer.  I could imagine that people with sensitive teeth could have a problem with these.Other Thoughts:Overall, I think these are good and tasty ginger snaps.  I happen to like ginger, so the strong ginger taste is fine by me.  That ginger spice burns lingers a good 15 minutes after eating these...My main issue with these is how crunchy they are; perhaps I got a batch that got over-cooked, or maybe they will fine tune them as production continues.So if you like ginger and you want to lean towards organics ingredients in your snacks, don't pass these up without giving them a try."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These ginger snaps are GREAT! They taste and look homemade. The ginger flavor is strong but not overpowering. The cookies have a crunchy texture (I agree with the reviewer who compared the texture to biscotti).  So, if you like your ginger snaps crunchy and with that pungent ""snap"" of ginger, buy these!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Bottom line first: these are tasty, and you can definitely taste the ginger.  I am a cookie fan first, and a ginger snap fan second, so I thought they were very good.My wife informs me that true ginger snap connoisseurs will notice that these are larger than most, and their texture is rougher than most.  If you simply must have small, smooth ginger snaps, I guess you should look elsewhere.But if it's all about the flavor for you, I think you'll enjoy these.  They are very fresh and spicy and flavorful, with pieces of ginger popping up randomly.The packaging is sort of interesting - the package does not include a zip-lock style re-sealing strip, but they do give you a piece of tape (attached to the outside of the bag) that you can use to keep the package closed between bouts of snacking.Also, is it just me, or would ""Bouts of Snacking"" be a pretty good name for a band?"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"When Paul Newman was alive his big foodie project was salad dressing - and it was GOOD.Then his daughter got into the mix and decided to peddle foods that are on trend with certain diets (vegan, organic, gluten free, etc.) and the results are dismal.Overpriced small portions that aren't particularly good or even when not awful are not better than other brands. These cookies are NOT good.Small in size I couldn't help but notice how everyone in the bag was uniformly burnt on the bottom. Surprisingly flavorless for a gingersnap UNTIL you bite into the candied ginger. Then you have a sudden burst of flavor stuck like a gummy candy to your teeth while the rest of your mouth is trying to process a hard cookie. Not my favorite sensation. Normally I love to dip my gingersnaps in milk, unfortunately even this did not improve them for me. I did not finish the bag and will not be recommending them to anyone else.If you love Paul Newman & want to support his charities - stick with the salad dressing.If you want a great gingersnap that is awesome with milk - get Stauffer's!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These cookies are awful. Amazon packed them in a padded envelope, so I figured I'd have a bag of crumbs, but every cookie was whole because they are as hard as rocks. The batch I got was full of burnt and blackened cookies. I ate half a cookie and threw the rest away.I thought I might have got a bad batch, but many other reviewers reported the same thing. I generally like  Own foods, but there is nothing redeeming about this cookies."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love ginger snaps and was excited to try  Own Organics Ginger Snaps.  At first taste you cannot distinguish these cookies from any other quality ginger snaps on the market.  They taste really good and have that amazing ""bite"" that real ginger gives.  Amazing.  Truly.Unfortunately the cookies cannot ride on flavor alone.  They are really hard.  So much so, that chewing them hurt my teeth (and I'm an ice cruncher, if that tells you anything).  I was chewing so hard on these that I bit my lip and inner cheek just trying to manage these snaps in my mouth.If I can get the exact same taste in another brand, but not mangle my mouth and give myself a headache while chewing, I will go with a different brand."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"These cookies are made with real ginger, which gives them a sharp, hot flavor. If you're used to artificial flavors it might seem strong, and I think this is the ""aftertaste"" that other reviewers are mentioning. But this ginger is the real thing. The cookies are small enough that you can eat several without consuming your day's calorie quota. These are great lunchbox items and they travel well. By the way, ginger is supposed to be good for stimulating your digestion and dispelling nausea, so there are good reasons to eat these, and not just because they taste good. :) ginger snaps have more surface texture than most store-bought brands, resulting in a somewhat grainy texture. It's not unpleasant. The cookies are not as hard as some ginger snaps I've eaten, but they're not really chewy, either. There's just enough give that you don't feel like you're going to break a tooth when you bite into them. I like to dunk ginger snaps in my coffee. Well, these held up just fine, without dissolving. So for all you cookie dunkers out there, I'm sure they'd survive milk, too."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These ginger snaps are great- tasty, crunchy, and not unhealthy. The ginger tastes very fresh, and the spices complement it wel. The cookies are sweet but not too sweet, and there's a bit of a kick in the aftertaste. They're very crunchy, too. As for nutrition, they're not exactly good for you, but they're low in fat and sugar for a dessert. For a serving of five, there are 3.5g fat, 1.5g saturated fat, 130 calories 0g cholesterol, and 12g sugar. The short ingredient list is mostly organic. These ginger snaps make a great snack!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"If my gramps taught me anything it was that cookies are for dunking.  These little tasty cookies hold up in the dunk process be it coffee, tea or milk.  The ginger taste is strong and distinct - if you ate these blindfolded you'd shout out ""ginger"".  The ingredient list was short and pronounceable and the calorie/fat ration was not too bad.  Organic is always a good choice and  is a brand name you can trust.  I'm going to try these Ginger Snaps as a pie crust ingredient instead of graham crackers - that's if I don't eat the whole bag first.  These are a good tasting cookie choice for that late afternoon pick-me-up."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"After taking a bite of these ginger snaps, I noticed how crisp and crunchy they are, the way cookies ought to be. Then I got a nice kick from the ginger, which left a slightly burning aftertaste in my mouth. I've had some bland, synthetic-tasting ginger snaps before, but these cookies lived up to the reputation of  Own. They really do taste old-fashioned and natural, and I'd buy them again. Now that Paul Newman is gone, it's nice knowing his legacy of really good, healthy food lives on."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Delicious!  This little snap has everything I want in a cookie.  It's very firm and crunchy (after all, it IS supposed to SNAP).  The texture goes from crunchy to chewy (at the end you will get  almost caramelized, chewy bits of real ginger, leaving your mouth enjoying that authentic ginger flavor).  While I enjoy a gingery taste, I don't always appreciate a hot feeling in my mouth.  This cookie doesn't do that to me.It's nice to indulge in sweets that are fairly healthy.  Eating something that doesn't have lots of chemicals in the ingredients list makes me feel better about eating it.  ' products rely on a reputation of being natural and of good quality.  These ginger snaps meet that requirement.  Being able to eat five cookies with just 130 calories is a plus, too.  And being so crunchy, they last a little longer.There's just one caveat to this product.  If you don't like ginger, you simply won't like this cookie.  I had six people test this ginger snap.  Those who don't care for ginger, did not like the cookie.  But, those of us who like ginger LOVED this cookie.  One of the taste testers is from Jamaica and she RAVED about them.Frankly, I can hardly wait until these ginger snaps are available at my local grocery store.  I want to buy them--now!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I ordered these cookies because they looked & sounded good. I really like Newmans coffee so I figured that these would really be good and they are. They do have a nice ginger spice flavor that is just right. Not hot at all. I am very pleased with these cookies & I will buy them again. I would also serve them to my family. Newmans own is a good brand."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I'm not a huge cookie fan.  I like my desserts fruity, cheesy or frozen with chocolate fudge on top, the one exception is ginger snaps.  I like them even when I'm not in the mood for something cookie'ish, I like them with tea, I like them with coffee, I like them with pepper jack cheese (everything goes with pepper jack). Also because they usually aren't terribly sweet and when I go to the trouble of baking them, they seem to last longer than other cookies (I mean they still taste good the next day, not that I can resist eating them all straight from the baking sheet).But these ginger snaps are not right.They are chewy and gritty.  Stale but burnt in places.  I know, it sounds like a manufacturing problem and I thought perhaps the unburnt, not stale ones would be okay if they were rebaked.  Nope.  I picked through the bag to find the snaps that weren't burnt, I put them in the oven to 're-crisp' at a low temp (250F) for about five minutes, in the end they still tasted bitter, gitty, stale and overly sweet.The price is right at around $3 a bag, but I think you'd be better off buying an old tried and true brand, such as Nabisco Ginger Snaps (sweetish, super crispy, reliably cooked for an even crisp texture) or Anna's Ginger Thins, my new favorite store brand of Ginger Snaps (they are wafer thin, spicy and go well with ice cream)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"The ginger taste in these cookies is just about right but I would have preferred a cookie a bit less hard/crispy. These are a bit too difficult to eat in that respect for my liking although I guess that's why the call 'em 'snaps'."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I've tried numerous brands of ginger cookies/snaps over the years and all of them fall short of expectations.  Then along came  Own.....  Taste is exceptional and exactly what a good ginger cookie should taste like!  I haven't tasted a great ginger cookie in the US in the many years I have lived here.  I'll be ordering more.  Trust me, they are best eaten after dunking in a cup of hot tea (with milk of course)!  Try it - you just might like it!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"From the real candied ginger bits atop to the flavorful ginger spices within, this organic cookie is hands down the best gingersnap cookie I've ever tasted. I highly recommend this brand of GingerSnaps!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"I never understood the appeal of ginger snap cookies.  The taste is sort of overbearingly sweet, you can't dip them in milk to lessen the strong taste (and plus they fall apart and sink to the bottom of the milk glass instead of turning soft) and well, the taste itself isn't very appealing either.  Not sure what kind of people these type of cookies are trying to target but it sure ain't the younger crowd, and it sure ain't me!  Usually when people hand me a plate of ginger snaps at an adult party or whatever, I take one bite just to be polite and crumble the rest of the cookie inside a napkin when no one is watching.  One of these days I'm going to get caught and then, well, let's just say I probably won't be receiving anymore party invitations. :)  Now I understand why my local grocery market used to have stacks of these cookies sitting on the main shelves in the front of the store.  Too many were shipped to the place and nobody wanted to buy any (and understandably so)."
"Amaurot Cookies",2020,"These Paul Newman ginger snaps were surprisingly tasty, especially considering that they are vegan and thus made without butter or eggs. They are satisfyingly crunchy with just enough softness on the inside to make the texture interesting. They taste strongly of ginger and have an overall great flavor, not too sweet and just spicy enough. If I could change 1 thing about these cookies, I would make the bags larger, so that there would be more cookies in each bag...the cookies disappeared too quickly! Six cookies (6.5 oz. total) is not enough, even if they are a fair size."
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are a really nice ginger snap with a very strong ginger taste.  If you don't care for ginger (why would you eat these if you don't?), then you may want to stay away.  I loved the crisp cookie with the spicy ginger flavor.  Really nice with a cup of tea or coffee...as well as dunked in milk!"
"Amaurot Cookies",2021,"These are the greatest ginger snaps I've ever eaten.  The bits of candied ginger set these far apart from the crowd.  They are also extra tangy compared to most ginger cookies.  Almost peppery if you eat too many, which I am prone to do.  I tried these under the Vine Program, and have since ordered two additional cases.Almost everyone who tries them loves them.  A few friends and family members find them to be too sharp to eat more than one.  But they always comment about that candied ginger!Excellent product."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"I love the flavor of these cookies. However, they can be a little tough to chew. You might best enjoy them with a cup of hot chocolate, or a cup of hot coffee, so you can dip them in the hot liquid to soften them up a bit. These would be a perfect bedtime snack with what my local coffee shop calls a ""steamed cow"" - a hot, steamed milk (usually flavored) made using the milk steamer on a cappuccino machine. These cookies are just spicy enough, and don't go overboard on the ginger, so they are just right. I love ginger  bread and ginger cookies, and I enjoyed these cookies, although they aren't very chewy right out of the bag."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"The ginger snaps had a nice, not too sweet flavor balanced with a good amount of ginger spiciness.  But overall I wasn't impressed. The cookies tasted a bit stale and were incredibly hard, although I am not sure if they were  overbaked, old or somehthing else.  Although they are organic the cookies left a funny aftertaste and I was incredibly thirsty after eating a few of these. I don't recommend these snaps and would rate them as mediocre."
"Amaurot Cookies",2022,"Very delicious cookies. I would highly recommend these to people that like tangy ginger flavored cookies. Very tasty and tangy. Nice bite sized cookies."
"Competitors",2022,"I love these cookies!  Not only are they healthy but they taste great and are so soft!  I will definitely add these to my grocery list!"
"Competitors",2021," Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with raisins are a delicious treat, great for anytime of day.  For example:--at breakfast, I had one with a large banana and a cup of coffee, and felt I'd had a relatively ""healthy"" start to the day.--the next day at lunch, following a tuna sandwich, I had one with a glass of milk, and was satisfied enough to not need a snack before dinner at 6:30.--the following night, after dinner, I had one with the remainder of my glass of wine. (Delicious!) And again, didn't feel the need to snack later in the evening.Each cookie is individually packaged, and their texture is soft and moist, with just the right amount of sweetness. Natural flavors used in the making are Cinnamon and All Spice.  These flavorings give the cookies a real old-fashioned, homemade taste.Nutritionally, the cookies have 170 calories each, 1.5g saturated fat, 150 mg sodium, and 12g sugar. They also have 2g of protein, and contain 25g of fiber.While the calorie count may seem a bit high for one cookie, they are good sized, and 1 cookie per serving is certainly enough to satisfy.Because of their great taste and texture, kids will probably enjoy them also.If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, give these a try!"
"Competitors",2020,"I am usually not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, but these literally melt in your mouth. They are so soft and tasty! I would definitely recommend these to someone who loves oatmeal, and even those like me who would probably pick a different flavor over this one."
"Competitors",2020,"I participated in a product review that included a sample of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH8M""> Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.  Okay first of all I love Oatmeal Raisin cookies and this one was no exception.  It was great!!! Soft n chewy, nice portion size and and as always a high quality product from  Oats.  Thanks to  and Influenster to for including this in their Mom Voxbox.  If you haven't tried it you need to and make sure to share it with the family."
"Competitors",2021,"I really enjoyed these individually wrapped big oatmeal cookies. They are really soft and chewy. You can buy different flavors. I will definately be repurchasing these cookies in the future. They are delicious and super healthy too."
"Competitors",2021,"I was surprised at how soft the cookie was. I usually buy Little Debbie's cookies, and I noticed the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie was bigger and had a bold taste."
"Competitors",2020,"I was recently given a complimentary ""vox box"" from , call the mom vox box. It came with various products in it for me to try out and review the products inside. One of the products i received was a  soft baked oatmeal cookie ""raisins"" flavor. When i opened the cookie wrapper, i gave half of it to my 3 year old and i ate the other half. I was immediately surprised by how soft the cookie was when i was splitting it in half. It was like a really really good home baked cookie. Soft, chewy and tasty. I normally do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, due to the raisins, but this cookie was surprisingly yummy. My three year old loved it so much that we had to go out and buy our own box. The cookies are soft, chewy, yummy, and healthier than other kinds of cookies, so  i would definitely recommend this product to people that have kids for a healthy yummy substitute to other sweets"
"Competitors",2020,"the best and freshest cookie that comes in a package, we ate them up, wishing we had more. soo good"
"Competitors",2021,"I am a huge fan of the  Chewy cookies! The moist cookies are satisfying and not too sweet. The high quality ingredients are a crowd pleaser. A must have for any car trip! After one cookie I was hooked. Highly recommend!"
"Competitors",2021,"yummy and delicious. i love eating it when it when its warm. the best store bought cookies! cant wait to buy more!"
"Competitors",2021,"I received a  Oatmeal Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie to try/eat for free from Influenster [...]). I shared the cookie with my kids, and we gobbled up the cookie faster than you can say "" Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookies."" It was soft (as advertised) and included a sufficient amount of raisins to make me happy (I like raisins). It was soft without being crumbly, moist, and not too dense (some oatmeal cookies are pretty dense). I highly recommend this cookie to anyone thinking of trying it for the first time:)"
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies were so good. Can't wait to go out and buy some more! A good snack when you don't want to over-indulge yourself"
"Competitors",2021,"I received these in my MomVox box from ! I loved it! Oatmeal cookies are my favorite and these are by far the best store bought brand I have tasted! I recommend these to anyone with a sweet tooth trying to stay healthy."
"Competitors",2022," Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies taste just like the cookies my grandma used to bake. Great to take as a quick breakfast since it is made with whole grain  Oats."
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are a real hit with my children! I received a sample from @Influenster in my Mom Vox Box. I enjoyed the sweetness, yet whole grain taste (which I love) and the moist raisins. This cookie would be perfect for breakfast, snack, or dessert! What could be better than that?! I love these cookies and definitely will be buying more!"
"Competitors",2020,"This was the most delightful cookie i ever tasted. I was very surprised on how soft and fresh it tasted. It makes a great snack on the go as well! I tried the chocolate almond as well and YUMMY!  hit  this one out of the park!"
"Competitors",2021," used some good ingredients in the cookie and one cookie eaten amongst four kids did not meet the nutritional panel for one cookie. Even if one cookie was eaten by them each the nutritional panel was pretty good.  So, I can be a happy mom about the children eating the cookie"
"Competitors",2021,"My daughter stole it from me and ate it, I guess it's a good thing I can't stand oatmeal.  But both my kids are already huge fans of all things  so it's easy for me to write this review. Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are chewy, nutrition and according to my kids, DELICIOUS.  They are made with Whole Grain  Oats, individually packaged at $2.69 for a box of 6, is a good source of fiber, only contains 6 grams of total fat per cookie and sold pretty much EVERYWHERE!"
"Competitors",2021,"I loved this delicious cookie! I even shared it with my 11 month old, and I'm a pretty big health nut when it comes to what I feed my daughter. It tasted great, was a great portion and it's not full of fats and sugars like all of those other cookies!"
"Competitors",2022,"I enjoy these cookies... They taste like my grandmas homeade cookies.. Plump and super soft!!! I can't wait to try the other favors made by quacker.l"
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies have perfect flavor, excellent moist/dry combination and are very soft. They melt in your mouth. I love the taste, I could eat box after box!"
"Competitors",2022,"I love oatmeal cookies and have made them at least hundred times.  I love my cookies, but these come in a very close second to my under baked, soft homemade ""vanishing oatmeal"" cookies.There's some ingredients in these cookies that I don't find in my kitchen cabinet, but if you're not against prepackaged food, it shouldn't bother you.I loved the allspice taste, but my guy friend didn't that much.  I think he's just partial to my cookies.  The individual serving size is nice.  I'm more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale.  I could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and..........They are delicious and make me feel like I'm eating something that is somewhat healthy for me.  After all, there is oatmeal in the cookie."
"Competitors",2021,"I love the soft bakes oatmeal raisin cookies.  The subtle taste of the oatmeal with the natural sweetness of the raisins is wonderful."
"Competitors",2020,"I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted these oatmeal cookies, they were delicious. It is a great go to snack when you are out and about and need something quick... and the kids love them!"
"Competitors",2022,"This was delicious. I was hesitant about trying it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was so delicious and soft. I like my cookies crunchy and well done. Lol When baking my own I usually lightly burn a few for me. But this cookie was so good. I think I will make an exception for the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisins"
"Competitors",2021,"I received a free sample of these cookies through Influenster and immediately got hooked on them. They're are so soft, perfect for anytime but specially for breakfast. My son loved them even though he doesn't like Oatmeal. I had to purchase more and now we treat ourselves every morning to a yummy cookie."
"Competitors",2021,"I loved the texture, the natural taste, and the softness was just right!!! If you are wanting a good cookie to take o the go, or for anytime, this is a very good choice!!"
"Competitors",2021,"First thought--not as good as homemade.  Second thought--good anyways.  Homemade oatmeal cookies are chewy, moist, a slightly crisp outer layer... but these cookies are cakey throughout.  The other thing that sets them apart from homemade cookies is a slight taste of preservatives--or something--something different and packaged-tasting about the flavor.  They're not too sweet, which I like.  My kids have started revolting against granola bars and protein bars as snacks on our day-trips--I think this would be a good thing to take instead.  Filling, good energy boost, tastes better than an energy bar."
"Competitors",2022,"These are nice soft, spicy oatmeal cookies with a rich molasses flavor.  They are a perfect single serving size, in a perfect individual wrap.  They have a good taste, natural, not artificial and are a satisfying snack.  I would buy these to take for a snack or lunch."
"Competitors",2021,"Good store bought cookie comes individually wrapped so every one is fresh.  Has a slightly burnt flavor, the bottoms of the cookies were very dark, almost burnt.  Soft and chewy with a sweet tast, could use more raisins and a stronger oatmeal flavor.  Overall, I liked them and my son loved them.  I guess the younger folks will like how sweet the cookie is.  Not like homemade but very good for store bought."
"Competitors",2022,"i was surprised i liked it! i normally don't like oatmeal cookies, but these were sooo soft and chewy. it was delicious. i shared one with my daughter and she wolfed it down!"
"Competitors",2022,"Oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite but I do enjoy them from time to time but you would never know it by this cookie.  The first bite was pretty terrible, though they did seem to get better about half way through the cookie.  It was so dry and had a sawdust kind of texture.  I think the problem is the main ingredient is ground up oats, then with whole oats and wheat flour, instead of the recipes I've made with more whole oats and then wheat flour.  Even though I don't really like raisins they were the best thing about these cookies.  At least a bite with a raisin was a tiny bit moister.Not only that but it was 170 for only one cookie.  If this was a diet cookie, maybe I wouldn't be so harsh about the texture, but 170 for one cookie sure isn't diet food.2 stars."
"Competitors",2020,"WOW, I gave it to my son to try and it was gone within SECONDS. Then he goes, ""Mommy, can I have more?"" and I had to then go out and buy some more of these great cookies. I was very impressed with the packaging and how SOFT the cookies really were when you opened them and the flavor that they had. Very Impressive. Would definitely buy!"
"Competitors",2020," products always mean good tasting.  They also mean a healthier option of processed snacks.  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookies are indeed soft and moist.  Each cookie is over an ounce; a nice size cookie.  You can see the whole oats and raisins.  I can taste the raisins and spices as well.  It is a tasty oatmeal raisin cookie.There are six individually wrapped cookies per box.  I like the individual wrapping as it keeps the cookies fresh and aids with portion control.  Per cookie you are looking at: 170 calories, 6g of fat, 27g carbohydrates, 4 g dietary fiber, 12g sugar, and 2g protein.  The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Nutritional facts are displayed on each individual wrapper as well, so nutrition, ingredient and allergy information is accessible even without the box or the internet.For a convenient, cheaper and healthier option, 's cookies are a good choice.  I recommend these cookies.  I hope to try the chocolate almond flavor next!"
"Competitors",2020,"This is more than just a cookie. It is a guilty pleasure. Except that you dont have to feel guilty because it is good for you. It is so soft and fresh you would think your grandma just baked it. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!"
"Competitors",2021,"I received a sample pack of the Raisin variety of  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster to test out with my family.My 22 month old son loved the cookie and almost ate the whole thing himself. I did manage a couple bites and I love the soft, chewy-ness of the cookie. Plus, it provides a good source of fiber, something we don't incorporate enough of in our diets sometimes. I will definitely consider purchasing more of these cookies as a snack for my son!"
"Competitors",2022,"The soft baked cookies are amazingly delicious! Even my children really enjoy them!! I was surprised when they all actually ate it because they never eat anything with raisins in it. This was exciting since I now keeps these with me in case the boys need a snack since they would be able to eat one between the four of them."
"Competitors",2020,"My kids will devour these cookies. They must be super good because believe it or not my kids are picky cookie eaters. I do not like raisins personally so I haven't tried them myself. My only negative thing I can think of is that they are very crumby because they are soft, so with kids it gets quite messy."
"Competitors",2020,", which knows a thing or two about oats, has put together a pretty nice oatmeal cookie here. The cookie is soft, as advertised, but is NOT pillowy, doughy, gooey or some other displeasing variety of soft. Rather, it just has a nice yielding softness. No doubt related to the consistency, the cookie is not cloyingly sweet. Oh, it's still definitely a cookie - but you're not overwhelmed with a sugar rush. The raisins didn't add a lot of flavor - the ones I encountered weren't large or anything remotely like plump.Overall, this seems like a relatively low-guilt addition to a lunchbox or a desk drawer for snack time. Tasty, soft, and full of oatmealy goodness."
"Competitors",2021,"After trying these cookies for the first time, i am hooked and dont feel guilty because they are delicious. Thanks  for another awesome product."
"Competitors",2022,"In one box you get six cookies, each individually wrapped.  Which is all meant to be quite convenient, I suppose.  Throw one in your child's lunchbox and send him/her off.  Frankly, these cookies are not nearly as delicious as the ones my husband and I make and ours are lower in fat and calories, with fewer additives.  In other words, healthier.But ""healthier"" isn't why most people buy pre-made food products and these cookies taste good enough.  I love oatmeal raisin cookies and I wasn't disappointed by these enough to dislike them.  However, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L5UD2K"">Grandma's Homestyle Oatmeal Raisin Big Cookie, 2.5 Oz Bag (Pack of 20)</a> are lower in calories and have the same amount of fat, per cookie.  (Of course, it's hard to eat just the one when there are two in the package so you'd have to share.)I know that it's hard to find time to bake from scratch sometimes but the effort to do so, teaching a child how to measure and mix a recipe from scratch, to then enjoy something that the two (or three or four) of you made together, is invaluable.  Make a double batch and freeze the dough before baking and you wouldn't have to do this every week to have enough cookies to last entire month or longer.  You'll build bonding moments, create less waste, teach simple mathematics and cooking skills, and provide a far healthier snack option for your child(ren).And if you truly don't have the time to bake cookies, then buy some fresh fruit.  If nothing else, you'll have fewer additives and most fruit comes in it's own convenient packaging."
"Competitors",2020,"Love these cookies my Son asks me to heat one for him in the microwave for about 15 sec its soooo good that way gives it the freshly baked feel...I always make sure to keep in stock in my home...they are also individually packed do makes it easy to carry along in my bag"
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are so soft and tasty. I love the texture of the cookie!! I will definitely be eating these cookies as a snack for lunch."
"Competitors",2020," Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies (raisin) fail the most important test of a cookie.  They are not delicious.  Considering they're 170 calories for ONE cookie you'd expect something decadent.  It's not even as tasty as an average cookie.A little bit dry considering it's supposed to be soft, moist cookie.  A slight sandy or grainy texture.  There's nothing foul or obnoxious about the taste - it's just nothing special.Nutritionally - ok for a cookie.  170 calories, 1.5g sat fat.  4g fiber!  (quite a bit.)  But I don't look at a cookie as some sort of health food.  A big* cookie like this should be an indulgence - a treat.  Instead it's not abhorrent.  If you start eating this, you'll finish it.  But you won't go out of your way for another one.*not THAT big.  It's not like a famous amos or something."
"Competitors",2022,"TOTALLY DIFFERENT!chewy, soft-baked cookie, Healthier alternative,Individually packaged / Good for on the go!The Verdict:Great Healthier snack for all the family!I don't like oatmeal & raisins... but this cookie really taste great! :D"

"Competitors",2022," Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are now my favorite cookies.  They are so soft and delicious.  And I love how they come individually wrapped so I don't have to worry about the rest of them going stale.I definitely recommend giving these cookies a try - you'll be glad you did!"
"Competitors",2021,"I got a sample of these from Influenster, and I went out and bought more right away.  These are the softest and tastiest packaged cookies I've had.  I love the flavor, Oatmeal Raisin cookies are my favorite.  Even though they are cookies, I feel like I could be doing a lot worse health-wise than these."
"Competitors",2021,"I received a sample package of this product complimentary from [...]  to try. I must say, it was super yummy. The cookies are large enough to satisfy my sweet tooth yet small enough that i didn't feel like I was gorging myself either. Best part is, they are healthy enough that i don't mind feeding them to my kiddos as a special treat."
"Competitors",2021,"Love the soft baked cookies, tastes great and I don't feel guilty eating this cookie. They are also individually wrapped so it's great for throwing in a bag for hiking or in kid's lunch. I tried the oatmeal raisin and must say it's my favorite, apparently many others favorites as I can never found them on the shelves."
"Competitors",2020,"I got the  box and it had several products in it.  My kids loved the  soft bake cookie.  would get some if I were you"

"Competitors",2020,"I just love the oatmeal raisein cookie it was super soft and delicious, i was amazed by the amount of raisens in it because there usually isnt enough in other brands. Not only did i love this cookie but my daughter loved it so much i had to go out and buy a box of them. Id def. reccomend these to any cookie lover, im a fan for life."
"Competitors",2020,"These are so yummy. They taste just like my grandmas homestyle cookies. They are a perfect texture, just enough sweetness, and leave you craving for more! I can't get enough of them. I eat them with a nice glass of cold milk and it's heaven!"
"Competitors",2021,"These are really good.  I love raisin cookies and this one did not dissapoint me.  It is soft and they are in individual packs.  I got it free from Influenster to try and liked it."
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies would be better if they were made with rolled oats instead of oat flour. The crumbly and mealy texture does not provide an enjoyable experience."
"Competitors",2021,"This cookie is full of flavor and at a great price.  I got a sample free in the mail, and will be buying more for my son!  We both loved them."
"Competitors",2022,"This cookie was moist chewy and delicious.  Both my daughter and I thought it was fabulous and I will definitely buy in the future."
"Competitors",2021,"This is pretty good for a store bought cookie! It was nice and soft, not too sweet. Just right. I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars because I like my cookies a little chewy. Overall great cookie! I got one of these cookies as a sample from @."
"Competitors",2022,"This cookie was really good... I liked the single serve packaging and the portability of the product! great for on the go and not loaded with junk!"
"Competitors",2021,"I am very impressed with the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. They are a healthier cookie and have a great taste. Very soft and melt in your mouth."
"Competitors",2021,"It's not too sweet so I like that. The kids love it and let's face it, cookies are generally not healthy, so this is ok, not the healthiest, but good!"
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are delicious, a little messy but have a great taste, my kids also enjoyed them, it is a lunch bag must have."
"Competitors",2022,"I'm not a lover of oatmeal raisin cookies, but this one surprised me! I loved how soft and flavorful it was. YUM. I highly recommend. I got these as a sample from Influensters!"
"Competitors",2021,"I love these. They taste great and they are easy to throw in your bag and bring a long with you for a snack for yourself or a child. My 3 year old liked the taste as well. I do think they are a bit pricey but they are full of whole grains which is better than normal cookies."
"Competitors",2022,"My son and I both LOVED these cookies, very yummy and delicious.  My son ate them so quickly that I hardly got any LOL.  I really like the texture of the cookies, and they are quite filling."
"Competitors",2020,"I received a  Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster, and it was a big hit.  Soft, chewy, and tasty.  Only thing I would change about it is that it doesn't travel very well because it gets too crumbly."
"Competitors",2021,"The  Oatmeal Raisin cookies could not be more delicious! They have that homemade taste w/out all the mess!! I was surprised at how soft they were and you could really taste cinnamon and other flavors, they did not taste processed.  The most important thing- my kids loved them too!"
"Competitors",2022,"I got to try these through Influenster. Though I'd planned to buy my own, I'm glad I had to do it for the site, because otherwise I wouldn't have tried the Oatmeal Raisin. I'm not a fan of the combo. I don't know why.But,  did a great job. There was the perfect combination of oatmeal to raisin, and I didn't feel like I was tasting cardboard, as I tend to with oatmeal cookies. Instead, it was super moist, and honestly, if it had been hot, I would have assumed it was straight from the oven. Just perfectly done!"
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are not only yummy but they are good for you. My children love them too. Its a great snack for them and I don't feel guilty giving it to them. Try one!!"
"Competitors",2021,"I do not like Oatmeal raisin cookies, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the soft texture and the taste of these cookies. I would recommend these if you love oatmeal raisin cookies."
"Competitors",2021,"I was pleasantly surprised with this cookie. It has a great flavor and was nice and moist! My three year old daughter loved it also!"
"Competitors",2020,"This cookie was very good, but a little dry for my taste! I would also prefer it to taste more like a homemade cookie with more raisins."
"Competitors",2020,"Great taste and packaging. Perfect for lunch boxes and take along snacks. We have enjoyed these cookies and look forward to more flavors."
"Competitors",2020,"Generally, these  oatmeal cookies were a disappointment.  The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only ""fortifications"" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%)."
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies are alright, except that once you are finished you may notice an aftertaste and I think this is due to the cookies containing too much allspice.  The cookies also contain cinnamon, which does not leave an aftertaste."
"Competitors",2021,"The  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie was given to me to sample through Influenster Mom Vox box program.  It tasted like it was home baked.  I did notice it was a little heavy in the cinnamon department, so if you don't like cinnamon or if you have an allergy to it, then this would not be a good cookie for you.  This was shared with my 14 year old daughter that gave her seal of approval, too."
"Competitors",2021," Cookies for me is that one in the package is suffice for me with a cup of tea or hot cocoa. Usually I go digging for a few more cookies to conquer my sweet tooth but not this time."
"Competitors",2020,"This is a really good cookie! DIdnt really think that I would like a cookie from a company known for its oatmeal, but completely surprised!! It was soft and soooo chewy! Really good served warm & with a cold glass of milk!"
"Competitors",2020,"I tried this cookie (which came free in my Mom Vox Box 2012) and I fell in love with it! My kids and my husband liked it, too! It is soft and chewy with a delicious home-baked taste. We will definitely include this in our stash of healthy goodies & snacks!"
"Competitors",2021,"I wasn't sure if I was gonna like these until I received a free sample and fell in love with it. These cookies are so soft and yummy. My 5 year old loved it. Can't get enough of it."
"Competitors",2020,"I originally purchased these cookies at the store and then being an  I received a sample of the Oatmeal Raisin  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. These make a great snack for kids and adults alike. These are great to carry in a diaper bag for that lil pick me up when out and about. They have so many flavors and styles of there new soft baked. They are soft but not crumbly, easy to eat not to chewy, they are filling and satsfying."
"Competitors",2020,"I'm not a fan of oatmeal or raisins (lol) but I wanted to taste the cookie before I gave it to my daughter. So I'll give my review based on how well she liked it. The cookie was extremely fresh when I opened it. My daughter ate about half of the cookie before putting the pack down. So I'll take that as she was somewhat satisfied because if she doesn't like it, she throws it aways and if she really likes it she'll eat it all! Ha! I am interested in finding out what other types of cookies are available because it is a more healthier alternative versus her eating chips or candy.**NOTE: In my review, I only took into account my thoughts on the cookie itself.  But if I had to grade this with the price that Amazon has it for, I would probably give it 1 star!  A 6-pack of these cookies is $2.69 so why is a 12-pack almost $35 on here?! Am I missing something, lol**"
"Competitors",2021,"These soft cookies are very tasty and have a great texture. They are just the right size for an afternoon snack."
"Competitors",2020,"I have only tried  Oatmeal raisin cookies and they were not my favorite, however Im still in love with their Oatmeal cereals and granola!"
"Competitors",2022,"Ok so I love oatmeal cookies they are amazing. And this is one that I approve on for its soft gooey and chewy. It is absolutely amazing. I love it, and would recommend it to anyone that loves oatmeal, and the raisins are sweet they do not taste tart and are not overpowering."
"Competitors",2020,"I love oatmeal raisin cookies, really love them.  So, I am always on the lookout for a good cookie...especially if they are made by someone other than me.  When I got the chance to sample  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins, I said ""Why not?""  The cookies come 6 to a box and are individually wrapped.  They are pleasant soft oatmeal with a balanced blend of spices and raisins.  I would have liked more raisins.  They were also very soft almost, as another reviewer mentioned...powdery.  They did have a good taste and they are very convenient (good for lunches, tucked in a backpack or desk drawer) and I found them very filling/satisfying.  But, for me, they were just a bit off mark.  I guess I expected a soft oatmeal cookie to be a bit more solid and chewy.  I will buy them occasionally if I have a specific need for something quick and easy."
"Competitors",2022,"I was pleasently surprised about how soft this cookie was.  It had great flavor, I couldnt even tell there were raisins in the cookie, which is great because I dont normally like raisins.  I like that they come individually wrapped so that all the cookies don't dry out when you want to eat one.  Great snack to take on the go!"
"Competitors",2020,"Theses cookies are yummy and soft even with raisins my toddler likes them. My only problem is one cookie had 170 calories and is not remotely filling. It's not the healthiest snack but it sure is tasty!"
"Competitors",2020,"Love single served cookies and they are a perfect as a pick-me up. I don't cookies in the house, but this one can stay all wrapped and waiting for the perfect moment"
"Competitors",2022,"QUAKER SOFT BAKED OATMEAL COOKIES RAISINS is a product consisting of a box of six cookies.  Each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope, with a tooth-edge at the top and bottom, suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope.  On the plus side, all of the cookies were intact, despite shipping.  The intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft (not crunchy) and secondarily due to the secure packaging.  The cookies were bland and unadventuresome, both in taste and in texture.  Although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout 12 whole raisins, it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside.  Therefore, the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump, juicy raisins.  In paying attention to the flavor, I noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor.  Also on the plus side, in knowing (from first-hand experience) that hard oatmeal can get wedged in between fillings, resulting in damage to teeth and fillings, the older consumer will be pleased that this QUAKER product is totally inocuous, as far as dental work is concerned.  These cookies are, indeed, sooooooft!Ordinary oatmeal has about 61 grams carbohydrate, 12 grams protein, and 7 grams fat, per 100 grams of oatmeal (Pomeranz (1987) Modern Cereal Science and Technology (pages 350-370)).  The NUTRITION FACTS label that this QUAKER product shows that the breakdown is as follows.  Each QUAKER cookie (42 grams) contains 27 grams carbohydrate, 6 grams of fat, and only 2 grams of protein.  Hence, it can be seen, that the cookies, as compared to straight oatmeal, is somewhat low in protein.  The low protein content should not be a concern to most adults, because growth, and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth, is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation, and for growing children.  If any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product, is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings, and need to worry about dental damage.  Although this cookie is fine for children, please remember that much better sources of protein are available, e.g., milk, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, tofu, and legumes (peas, beans, lentils)."
"Competitors",2022,"I love homemade oatmeal raisin cookies, the kind that are a little chewy, made with lots of oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and not too many raisins.  So I was skeptical of this soft, ""store bought"" cookie.  I assumed it would be, well, bad.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's made with whole grains, which imbues each cookie with 16% of daily fiber recommendations.  It was indeed soft, but it didn't seem artificially so, more like it was just cooled down from the oven.As I began my 'taste test', I appreciated the fact that the cookies are individually wrapped, which allows for easy transport in lunches or purses.  I took a small bite at first, because I was already prepared to be disappointed.  As that bite went down, I reached for another.  Then another.  Very tasty, as it turned out!  Soon the cookie was gone and I realized I wanted another one!  However, at 170 calories each, these are NOT ""low calorie"", they're just made with better ingredients than most.As for other nutrition information (other than the fiber and calorie count mentioned above), each cookie has 150 milligrams of sodium, so not too bad there.  You'll find 4% of calcium and 8% of iron (recommended daily requirements).The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Sugar is about number 10 or so on the ingredient list.  One quibble I have is that the list of ingredients is rather lengthy.  My nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists, probably means there's lots of stuff in there that's not exactly ""good"" for us, but it is what it is:  a factory-made, store-bought cookie that's got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that don't come naturally to ""homemade cookies"".  Just accept it for what it is, a decent, convenient mass-produced cookie."
"Competitors",2022,"The folks at  really got the soft texture here, and the individual packages keep the cookies very soft and fresh.I would have liked more raisins, I couldn't hear ""it thru the grapevine"".Good nutrition for a cookie."
"Competitors",2021,"Taste: I thought these did a good job of mimicking the taste of home made cookies. Cinnamony and raisiny (though the raisins aren't big plump raisins...they're more suggestions of raisins...and they are sweetened by sugar and fructose NOT HFCS.Mouth feel: When Mom makes oatmeal cookies, you can feel the oat meal (usually) when you are chewing. This doesn't have that. The oats are milled to the point where the flavour is there but the texture is not. If this is a problem for you, you might want to pass. Other than that, it's probably a good idea to have a glass of milk handy. They are ""moist"" in that they aren't crunchy...but they verge on dry.Value: On Amazon, the cookies come to about .50$ a piece. Which is comparable to my local grocery.A good all around (large) cookie and I think I will try the other varieties...you should too!"
"Competitors",2020,"The box says, ""soft baked oatmeal cookies"" and that is exactly what you get!  The cookies are individually packed, which makes it easy to grab for lunches, or to throw in a purse or backback for ""on the go"" kids.  The cookies are fairly good sized, and packed with raisins.  I was concerned about an aftertaste that I have sometimes noticed with cookies that are pre-packaged (maybe a preservative that is often used?) but I did not notice any funny taste or smell to these cookies.  In fact, I could not find anything I was unhappy with!"
"Competitors",2022,"Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite.  Oats has done these well with this new product. The strongest flavor to come off is, perhaps surprisingly, cinnamon. It's a very strong taste at the tip of your tongue. The cookie also does have enough raisins for it to qualify as oatmeal raisin, which was something I was concerned about at first.The cookie is very soft and still tastes pretty fresh, even after all the packing and processing that obviously went into it. They're about as big as you'd imagine it to be from the picture on the box, which is actually impressive given how often cookies end up being smaller than they appear. Overall, this is a good choice if you want cheap, store-bought oatmeal cookies."
"Competitors",2022,"This oatmeal cookie was delicious - soft, full of raisins and not too sweet or sugary.  Full of whole grain, I feel confident eating this cookie and giving it to my family to eat as well.  Great item to have in the bag for a quick snack that feels like a treat and is filling too!  Thanks to  and Influenster for introducing me to this product!"
"Competitors",2020,"Quick breakdown of the cost.  For $34.71 you got 12 boxes of 6 cookies.  That's about $2.90 a box, and 49 cents per cookie.  NOT too bad.Taste-This is a denser cookie than I usually enjoy, especially when it comes to my oatmeal raisin.  (My favorite cookie, by the way!)  It almost has a cake like consistency, and while it isn't the type of cookie I would munch on at home while I watch a Blu-Ray, this is the type of snack I would buy for road trips or picnics.  There is a hint of brown sugar, not overwhelming, but enough that my little ones (8 and 4) remarked that they liked the sweetness of it.  My oldest, wished there were more raisins, and I would have to agree with that as well.  But I liked the whole grains. Overall, it is good, but a bit dry.Size-this is a larger cookie, similar to what you would get in say Subway or Starbucks.  Not overly huge, but not too small either.  I think this is a perfect snack size.Nutrition-at 170 calories it isn't a lightweight, but nor is it overly fattening either.  6 Grams of fat, 1.5 grams of Saturated (NOT horrific), but it has some Polyunsaturated and 3.5 grams of Monounsaturated=the 'good' kind of fat.  4 grams of fiber, good in a snack like this, but only 2 grams a protein, wish there was more.All in all, this isn't a snack I would buy on a regular basis.  Maybe once in awhile for school lunches, and I would certainly get this for a road trip, or a hike.  Compared to many other snacks like this, it is a decent value for the money, and if you enjoy a thicker cookie, this is right up your alley!"
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies are soft and chewy and the real raisins add a nice touch.  While they are 170 calories per cookie, the good taste makes them worth it.  They are also individually wrapped which makes them easy to add to a packed lunch.  They are almost as good as mom used to make!"
"Competitors",2022,"I sampled this product for the Influenster Mom Vox Box that I received in the mail.  I am purchase  cereals on a regular basis and was excited to try this cookie.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the cookie and felt it stayed true to the  brand.  I did not like the fact there were so many preservatives in the cookie like TBHQ and BHT.  For those reasons I will not be purchasing this on a regular basis."
"Competitors",2021,"The  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie with Raisins were so moist with a fresh baked taste.  They had just the right amount of raisins to make them taste just like home made cookies."
"Competitors",2020,"I recieved the  Soft Baked Oatmeal and Raisins Cookie in my Influenster Mom Voxbox 2012. My husband and kids devoured the cookie before I had a chance to look at it or taste it. So this is what they thought of the cookie. It was sooooo good according to my 4 year old son and 3 year old daughter. My husband said it was moist and soft and delicious. He is most definitely ready for me to asdd it to the grocery list. I gave this product a 5 star rating because these cookie totally rock!!!"
"Competitors",2022,"I like soft cookies, but most of the ones you buy taste ""fake"".  Really enjoyed the  Soft Baked with Raisins.  I recieved a sample in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster and loved it.  I buy them to use as quick snacks, taste sweet and delicious but are healthier than other options."
"Competitors",2020,"This cookie was very moist but it did not crumble when you took it out of the package.  It was full of flavor but it didn't satisfy your snack hunger.  I will definitely be buying more of these"

"Competitors",2021,"I got the opportunit to try  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster in my Mom VOX BOX.I enjoyed the chewy, soft-baked cookies made with wholesome  Oats and delicious raisins. They are cookie and not as moist as a bar, but wonderful none the less. They offer the following benefits: -Made with Whole Grain  Oats-Individually packaged-Provides a good source of fiber-Contains 6 grams of total fat per serving"
"Competitors",2022,"My kids absolutely love these cookies and theyre healthy too! and as a mom i dont mind my children eating these!"
"Competitors",2022,"As part of Influenster I received a Mom VoxBox full of great products to try and review.  Included was a  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie.  I don't like raisins so I gave most of it to my kiddos.  I did take a taste though and it was delicious.  A lot of store bought oatmeal cookies don't taste good at all but this was so good.  You could see the oats and everything.  What a great special treat to have with whole grains to get that extra fiber we all need.  I can't wait to go and buy some in a different flavor.  :)"
"Competitors",2022,"This is one of the best tasting, soft cookies we had in a very long time!  The kids were fighting over who had the last one!"

"Competitors",2021,"Great when you're in the mood for a good, filling cookie! They are soft and tase great, and they're better than chocolate chip especially for kids."
"Competitors",2022,"My family and I tried the Soft Bake Oatmeal Cookies and we loved them. I personally like to put them in the microwave for a couple of seconds to warm them; then it is just like a fresh baked cookie!"
"Competitors",2020,"I received a  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie and oh em GEE.  This was a cookie that was just as good as the ones my Grandma used to make when I was little.  I shared half with my son and he kept saying MMMMM MMMM mommy MMMMM!  Highly recommend this cookie to anyone!"
"Competitors",2021,"I loved how the cookie was nice and soft when I opened the packaging. It seemed to be made of fresher ingredients. I decided to split the cookie in two and let the kids each have one side. I had to split it because the package only had one cookie in it. My daughter devoured it, my son...he saw there were raisin's in it and freaked out. K ended up eating her brother's half as well. I was bugged for days by her for another cookie so she must have loved it since that's how 3yr olds express love for food! (I WANT MORE COOKIE!)I didn't get a chance to personally try the cookie, but over all it seemed good and from a brand that I like and trust, it also smelled pretty yummy!"
"Competitors",2022,"this cookie is amazing i couldnt think of a better snack for my daughter during the day to give her  it healthy and it taste great  and i loved how soft the cookie was"

"Competitors",2022,"These cookies tastes so good. If you heat them for a few seconds in the microwave before eating, they taste like they just came out of the oven. Very fresh!"
"Competitors",2020,"My family and I tried this cookie and we all had different responses. I thought it was too sweet and did not taste like I home baked cookie. My husband thought it was too dry and crumbly and my son thought it was yummy.... he is 9."
"Competitors",2022," wins again with these delicious cookies.  I was particularly loving the individually wrapped aspect of the oatmeal raisin cookies.  I hate opening a box and having half of the cookies go stale because the air gets to them.  These are so easy to throw into your bag or just grab one when you want and they are always fresh, soft and yummy."
"Competitors",2022,"I thoroughly enjoyed trying out the  soft-baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies as part of the Influenster program.  The cookie was moist, soft, chewy... everything an oatmeal raisin cookie should be.  The taste was superb - just the right amount of cinnamon & nutmeg - and it was super filling and held me over perfectly until dinner time.  When I tried them out, I was 8 months pregnant and constantly hungry, so for a cookie to be able to hold me over for that long... color me impressed!"
"Competitors",2022,"Awesome cookies . Great snack to have in the cupboard when you want something quick and sweet. The quality is amazing , worth every penny and then some."
"Competitors",2020,"I love these cookies, I will have to hide them from the kids because although they would be easy to throw into a lunch box they are nice and healthy for a cheat every now and then."

"Competitors",2020,"This cookie package was featured at the local supermarket, so I picked up a pack for a road trip I was going on.  I liked the fact the cookie was soft (probably the reason the cookie was individually wrapped), and the taste was almost as good as homemade.Four solid stars for the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie.  Just shop on price; if the price is good, you'll enjoy your treat."
"Competitors",2020,"This was delicious! Add a glass of milk and you have a kids favorite snack! If you love soft cookies these are perfect for you. Wish more came in a box!"
"Competitors",2022,"I got a sample of one of these cookies through .com. After trying the cookie they sent, I went and bought a box of them. The kids love them!! They are a quick and easy snack on the go. They are a bit crumbly, but well worth it to see their smiling faces."

"Competitors",2021,"After trying this cookie I can honestly say it was not all that bad...however, I did notice a vitamin like after taste that at times was a bit over powering. I also didn't like how crumbly it is but your gonna eat it anyway so I can over look that"
"Competitors",2021,"I absolutely loved this cookie. I received this as a free sample but I couldn't just have one so I went out on a search for them and found them at my grocery store. I was so happy because that one big cookie was everything I have been looking for, not too sweet, not too bland, not salty, not too many rasins and most of all not many calories. The perfect snack, especially with a cup of tea and a book..."
"Competitors",2020,"I enjoyed these cookies. They are delicious and not too sweet. The price is very affordable. I received the product to test and went out and bought a box."
"Competitors",2020,"This cookie taste wonderful.  What's even better is it is good for you too. It does not taste like you are eating oatmeal.  It is a great treat or meal on the run."
"Competitors",2021,"My daughter loved my free sample of this cookie from . She goobled it right down, which i didn't think she would. She's not the biggest fan of rasins. I tried a bite and thought it was kinda dry myself but if my daughter loves it, i will buy it again! :)"
"Competitors",2022,"my children love these cookies and so do I. They are soo moist and delicuos. These by far are the best tasting oatmeal cookies I have EVER had."

"Competitors",2022,"To me, the perfect oatmeal cookie would be soft and filled with those soul-comforting warm spices that kind of remind you of Christmas and that is exactly what you get with the  Oats Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie.  Perfect for a mid-morning snack with a cup of coffee."

"Competitors",2022,"These were amazing! Out of the oven fresh, and full of flavor! Best store bought cookies I have ever tried."
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are fantastic! I usually don't like ""Chewy"" cookies because of their textures but i just LOVED these! They tasted amazing! They tasted as if they were just made! Warm them up for a few seconds in the microwave and bam! Yummy ""fresh baked-like"" Cookies!"
"Competitors",2022,"Very soft and chewy. The whole family loved them and I usually don't like raisin cookies but these were very delish!"
"Competitors",2020,"Loved them!I opened the box and got the items out and took a picture. My son saw the cookie and got super excited. I opened the cookie and took a bite then set it down to grab a drink. I came back, and it was gone! My 3 year old had destroyed it! lol.We both agreed it was really good and ran out to buy a box of them. We enjoyed them together that night after dinner with some cookies. Yummy!"
"Competitors",2022,"I received one of these  Soft Baked Cookies in my Influenster Mom Voxbox I was hesitant to eat it as it was 170 calories their are lower calorie alternative snacks out there and cookies but this is as close to homemade as you get i liked that its soft baked and breaks apart easily the overall taste was pretty good as well. Not a purchase for me unless they were to cut about 50 calories from it."
"Competitors",2022,"The  Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies were delicious! They were soft and chewy and full of whole oats. My kids gobbled them up and wanted more. I had one with my chamomile tea and the kids enjoyed theirs with milk. I would definitely recommend these cookies for the whole family."

"Competitors",2022,"I dont like how it tastes because i don't like oatmeal or raisins but if you like them then i think its good to eat these cookies because they're healthy and you will probably like the taste."
"Competitors",2022,"I would definitely recommend getting these cookies.  They taste awesome. Great snack at home or on the go. Really not pricey. Everyone should try them!"
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies taste so good. They are fresh and moist! I like that they are the perfect size and that they are individually wrapped."
"Competitors",2022,"Not really a cookie lover and specifically not and oatmeal & raisin fan but it was really tasty and fresh!!  Received this as a sample."
"Competitors",2021,"In our house we LOVE love LOVE cookies! So this cookie was put to the test, and it totally passed with flying colors.  The tase of it was just so delicious and soft. My daughter (5yrs old) loves these too.  So I don't mind giving this to her because it is a healthier cookie."
"Competitors",2022,"this is a good cookie very soft and moist I wished they made an oatmeal chocolate chip my kids loved them and I would buy again"
"Competitors",2022," always has high quality products. I like these cookies. They have a great texture and great taste. And they are a good size.  Individually wrapped in foil packets for freshness. Good taste with a nice hint of cinnamon. If you like cinnamon you will love these cookies."
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies taste really good.  The only oatmeal cookies I like better are the chewy ones made with more sugar (carmelization!).Given the moderate (12g) amount of sugar in these, they taste great, and actually make sense as an energy snack.Likes:- Fiber!  4g per cookie.- Nutrition: Easy on the fats and sugars.- Soft, semi-chewy texture.  Raisins are just chewy enough.Dislikes:None really.Individual packaging is nice for taking them with you.  Always like to see less packaging but these aren't too wasteful on materials.Recommended."
"Competitors",2020,"I got these in the momvoxbox from .I am a cookie lover,however these were not my favs.My toddler loved them but he will literally eat almost anything sooooo that doesn't say a whole lot."
"Competitors",2020,"I am a cookie lover, so I was excited to get to try this product for free through the Amazon Vine program.  Unfortunately, these are just not very good.They are too crumbly, almost powdery, as if maybe they weren't baked enough.  The flavor is okay, but certainly nothing special.  They are soft, but the texture is not pleasant.They remind me of ""Grandma's Cookies"".  Except they are about half as good."
"Competitors",2020,"My cookie-hound husband was into them almost before they were out of the mailbox.  The quality and taste are very much the same as Archway brand; that is a good thing as I consider them to be the best store-bought cookie out there.  My husband would have liked more whole oats in the mix, but understands that too few people appreciate texture in their food.The individual wrapping might be nice for kids' lunches but is an expensive and unecological waste for the (typical) case that a group will be eating them and/or individuals will eat more than one.  At the very, very, least wrap them two-at-a time?If they're priced similarly to Archway, I would expect them to do at least as well as the equivalent Archway cookies."
"Competitors",2022,"These individually sealed oatmeal raisin cookies are tasty, and soft, but a bit dry. They need to be a little more moist, especially since the whole point of cookies in individual foil wrappers is to protect moisture. The taste is traditional cinnamon raisin, and the taste is fine, but in this crowded market, with many competitors,  cannot afford for the cookies not to be perfectly moist.I remember back when the  Oats came in a round, cardboard container. On the side of that container was a recipe for oatmeal cookies, which my mom used to make frequently. Those cookies, with Nestle's chocolate chips added, were the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I ever tasted. Now, if  could market those cookies and make 'em taste as good as mom's, then they'd have something."
"Competitors",2021,"They're cookies so they're not just terrible, but I've had lots better soft-baked cookies than these.  They are pretty bland, just a mild raisiny sweetness and the texture is dry and crumbly and turns a little mealy upon chewing.  I tried them in coffee and in milk to see if they were better that way and while the taste was a little better the texture just became wet and mealy and bits fell off into my coffee.  A soft cookie can definitely be moist, hold up to milk and have a bit of chew to it.  Pepperidge Farm makes an addictive soft baked oatmeal cookie."
"Competitors",2020,"One star for being soft. One for having oatmeal. One for having raisins. But that's it. These cookies taste fine, but they are pretty dry and fairly crumbly. Not overly enjoyable. They'd be fine dunked in milk or something, but I'd be afraid half of it would fall into the glass. Little Debbie and Pepperidge Farms have both proven that you can sell packaged, soft-baked cookies that are still moist. Plus, these seem over-packaged. Individually wrapped cookies? Okay, yeah it's handy for a packed lunch or something, but really? That seems excessive. I'd probably skip these."
"Competitors",2020,"This is a great product. Moist flavorful cookie that is packaged nicely so you can take it on the go. This is a great to go breakfast or a snack anytime of the day."
"Competitors",2021,"Tasty cookie!  It was soft, though maybe just a little dry.  The raisins were actually nice and juicy, not all dried up like in most packaged cookies.  Pretty good overall."
"Competitors",2020,"This cookie is big enough to share! I love the taste this cookie is more on the dry side not so much chewy so if you like the harder drier cookies this is for you!"
"Competitors",2022,"I received this product free to test from Influenster.com and couldnt have been more excited to try.  I love soft baked cookies, but I find that whenever i try to buy ones that are already made, they don't taste fresh.  The  Soft Baked Cookie is large and fulfilling.  The taste was fresh as though it had been made right in your own kitchen.  My kids loved the oatmeal raisin and it had just the right amount of raisins in it.  This will be the ONLY type of soft cookie I will buy from here on out!  I love the quality of  products!"
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are so good and soft as promised!  Def recommend them to anyone and everyone that is looking for a good cookie at a good price!"
"Competitors",2021,"I love Oatmeal Cookies so I was really looking forward to trying these.  They are so good and soft my favorite combo with a oatmeal cookie."
"Competitors",2020," soft baked oatmeal cookies are so good they are soft which is a plus and the taste is great"
"Competitors",2020,"The cookie is very soft, chewy, tastes great and good for you. Provides a good sourse of fiber. You fins almost at any store."
"Competitors",2020,"After trying these for a review for Influenster, I ended up buying a box of these because they were so good! They are soft and they come in individual packages so you can just take on the go. My kids loved these too and since they are a lot healthier then other cookies, I will definitely be purchasing more."
"Competitors",2020,"I got this is my Mom Vox Box from Influensters to try and my little daughter ate it right up! She thought she wouldn't like it because of the rasins but, she loved it!!! She said it was very soft and yummy! She said it reminds her of grandmas cookies! It tasted like homemade cookies she said! She loved them so much she asked to buy her more every time we go to the store!!! I was very impressed!"
"Competitors",2020,"I will absolutely purchase this item.  I received one of these in my Voxbox, and liked it right away.  The flavor is delicious, and it has a chewy, soft consistency (which I prefer in cookies)."
"Competitors",2022,"I received this product to test as a part of my Mom VoxBox from Influenster.com. As I was going through all the products I was sent to test I opened the  Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie and ate it. I was pleasantly surprised. I have not eaten an Oatmeal cookie since I was a kid.  Taking that first bite brought me right back to my childhood where my mom would bake oatmeal cookies for my grade school parties.  The  cookie is very soft and has just the right amount of raisins.  The raisins do not take away from the taste of the oatmeal. I have already bought two boxes of these and will continue to add these cookies to my bi-monthly grocery lists.  Try these cookies you will not regret it!!"
"Competitors",2021,"i receive this at a mom voxbox .com i love this cookie its sooo yummii i will buy more of this cookies"
"Competitors",2020,"I received this product to test as a part of Influenster.com. I really don't like oatmeal cookies, but this was definitely a mind changer. It was so soft. It was mouth watering when I smelled it. I smell all fods before I eat them, especially if I am unfamiliar with them,don't ask why, because I don't know lol. But these were great and it was gone before I finished looking through the box. These are definitel great for healthy snacking and I know kids love them dearly. I can't wait to try the other cookie flavors! Thanks "
"Competitors",2022,"I received this cookie in my moms voxbox from .com. It was delicious. My only complaint is that is was a little crumbly, a little too messy for kids. Perfect for me however and I was not sharing so it was fine :-)"
"Competitors",2022,"The first thing I noticed when unwrapping my  cookie was the smell. I smelled fresh baked good as soon as I unwrapped my cookie. I received the oatmeal raisin cookie, I'm not a fan of raisins but I was willing to give the cookie a try just based on the amazing smell. When I took my first bite I was in love, the cookie was soft and moist and when it was gone I found myself wanting more. I totally recommend people try this amazing cookie for themselves."
"Competitors",2022,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KK56JU""> Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies 6 count box (8.8 oz.), Raisins (Pack of 4)</a>I received this cookie in my moms voxbox from .com. I am not usually a cookie person unless i am baking them myself, but in this case i really enjoyed this cookie. I was even more surprised by the nutrition facts, a cookie good this good should not be good for you. I will definitely be picking up a box on my next shopping trip."

"Competitors",2021,"I received one of these cookies from Influenster and I am always reluctant to try pre-made cookies because they make my teeth hurt. I was pleasantly surprised when my teeth didn't hurt and the cookie made me think of cookies from my childhood. The cookie was fresh and was soft and I am not a huge fan of raisins but honestly I enjoyed them in this cookie. I will be buying a box of these as they are a great snack item for the kids."
"Competitors",2022,"The kids LOVED this, but I mean, hey it's a large, soft, chewy cookie, of course they are going to love this. Hubby is a little more accustomed to my homemade cooking so he could take it or leave it. I thought there could be a few more raisins in it.Thank you  for allowing me to try this product."

Once it came out of the box, it was out of the wrapper and I had to split it 3 ways cause the kids saw it and had to have some.  Love the soft, chewy goodness and the flavor is so great and pure.  We are headed out to get some more!*I recieved this product compliments of Influenster however all opinions are my own."
"Competitors",2022,"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from  and Influenster. I didn't hardly get it out of the box before my 2 year old spied it and had to try it! We split the tasty cookie and both really enjoyed it. I have since bought some of the crunchy  cookies which are really good too, but I really do like the soft, chewy oatmeal raisin cookies for my daughters. It's great afternoon snack and easy to pack in my purse for trips to the zoo or swimming. Also, since there  cookies it's a brand I trust and have used for years so that makes me feel happy about the choice I'm making for my children."

I did manage to steal a piece and it is amazingly good! I will definitely be buying these regularly!"

"Competitors",2021,"My 5 yr old son loved the cookies. I enjoyed it as well, I am just used to cookies being a bit sweeter."
"Competitors",2020," soft baked oatmeal cookie....ITS SO YUMMY!!! added on with a cup of milk, its chewy it isnt too sweet or not sweet at all."
"Competitors",2022,"I cannot rave enough about these cookies. I received a complementary cookie in my mom Vox box just a few days ago and within the same week bought an entire box to share with my family. These cookies are soft , generously sized and delicious. Definitely a good buy."
"Competitors",2022,"I am in love with these cookies. They are soft and chewy, and I love how they are individualy wrapped so I don't have to worry with them going stale once I open the box. I definitely would reccomend them to anyone who likes oatmeal cookies or to anyone wanting to try something new."
"Competitors",2022,"I don't normally like oatmeal cookies, but these cookies are so soft, moist, and melt-in-your mouth delicious that I fell in love. I think it's absolutely brilliant that  Oats has started making oatmeal cookies! They are the experts on oatmeal! I can't wait to see what new flavors they come up with next. So far I've had the Oatmeal Raisin and the Banana and they were both very good. I also love the convenient single serve packaging, which is great for my daughter's school lunches."
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are very tasty and soft! I received a complementary cookie in my mom vox box and will definitely be buying more!"
"Competitors",2021,"I don't usually like raisins in my cookies, but I got to try it out and this cookie was yummy!  It was filling and satisfying, too."

"Competitors",2021,"My kids loved this cookie!! It was so soft it like melt in ur mouth! I would def buy this cookies again! U will need milk or water while u eat it tho its a little bit drying while eating. :-)"
"Competitors",2021,"Although not homemade they are as close as you are going to get in a packaged cookie!  They are really soft and full of flavor!  Just big enough to satisfy your sweet tooth too.  My kids really enjoyed these so I will repurchase!"
"Competitors",2021,"When I first opened the package, I felt like a little kid again!  The cookie smelled just like the creamy oatmeal cookies my mom used to make when I was little!  I did not used to get heartburn as a little kid, though, and there was the drawback!  My tummy is just too tender for those crazy oats!"
"Competitors",2021,"I'm glad I got to try this before I actually purchased it.  I would not purchase these.  The initial flavor was ok then it left a kind of chemically after taste.  It kind of reminded me of eating a cookie with the texture of a biscuit.  I definitely needed something to wash it down."
"Competitors",2020,"The  Oatmeal cookies were absolutely delicious; soft, sweet, and perfect in every way! I will definitely be buying these often! They are very flavorful and just melt in your mouth!"
"Competitors",2022,"I am the type of person who would rather bake something myself because I am so picky about taste and texture.  Let me just say that  NAILED this cookie!  It's awesome!  Somehow it stayed soft and moist, and tasted like it was baked that morning.  Thanks for a quick, easy and healthy snack !"
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are so great! They are soft and chewy and taste delicious. I really love homemade cookies right out of the oven, but these taste just as good!  sure makes a great cookie!"
"Competitors",2022,"I received a  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster to try out and ended up really liking them. I shared the original cookie with my 3yo daughter and husband both of whom enjoyed it also. I actually ended up buying a box the next time we went grocery shopping.The flavor of these is quite nice and the cookies are large and soft. I was impressed with the fact that they're moderately healthy and liked that they weren't too sweet.The cookies are a bit expensive, and I'd prefer to make my own to have more control over the ingredients, but they are a good shopping choice. They're great for short trips or an emergency snack. I'd definitely buy more of them, but not on a weekly basis."
"Competitors",2021,"Delicious, fresh-baked cookies without the hassle or trouble of making them!  can't wait to  taste more of their different flavors, so yum!"
"Competitors",2020,"cookie was so great nice and chewy the raisans was sweet and moist. everyone should give them a try you will love them. :)"
"Competitors",2020,"I received one from Influenster and love these cookies because it's soft and chewy without being too sweet. I just wish these were more readily available."
"Competitors",2021,"I received this  oatmeal raisin cookie in my MOMVOXBOX from Influenster and when i tell you this cookie was soft and chewy and so delicious i dont even like oatmeal raisin cookies so i was very hesitant at first to try it. But after i took that first bite i was in love and i instantly went to the nearest walmart and bought a box of oatmeal raisins cookies. This is a product that is worth a try and you also try the other flavors too and hey i even warm my cookies for a couple seconds in the microwave to get the fresh out the oven warmth going on but like i said try it. This cookie is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Competitors",2022,"I was recently given a package of the  Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. I'm already a huge fan of almost all  products, and these cookies didn't disappoint. They're SUPER soft, and weren't dry whatsoever!!! The oatmeal cookie part has a great flavor, no weird aftertaste like some cookies do. The raisins were decent, nice and plump, juicy, didn't have the dried out look, and there were enough of them in the cookies, but not too many (meaning the kids will still eat them, lol). They were good sized cookies, individually wrapped to ensure freshness, and had a delicious taste. Now I'm craving them! Overall, they were a great cookie! I'd definitely purchase them again. Can't wait til they're back in stock on Amazon!"
"Competitors",2021," Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies taste closest to homebaked cookies than any others I have tried. My kids loved them, too. They are moist and flavorful. We like them as a snack, or even as a breakfast on the go!"
"Competitors",2022,"Very very tasty! I received a sample cookie through ! This cookie was an amazing guilt free treat! Moist and full of flavor. I had an oatmeal raisin, but there are other flavors. Definitly worth buying. Much healthier than other cookies!"
"Competitors",2022,"This was a great cookie.  I was very happy with how soft it was.  Being in the individual wrapping made it easy to through in the diaper bag or purse.  My 18 month old son loved the cookie.  Would love to have these in the house at all times.  Such a healthier way to enjoy cookies."
"Competitors",2022,"i love this cookies so does my family bought more this week when we went to the store i plan to keep this all the time they are a great snack"
"Competitors",2021,"Let's be honest: there are few desserts that can compete with a fresh baked, chewy oatmeal cookie. Even better when it's oatmeal raisin! As such, I was somewhat skeptical of the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies, as I'm generally let down by store-bought cookies. Well, I'm here to tell you, I have become a believer. I have seen the light! Here's a breakdown of what I think overall:TEXTURE:The package says ""soft-baked,"" and brother, it is no lie. These cookies are soft, moist and chewy, thus negating the need to do the milk dunk. Though, ice cold milk is a requisite with cookies, regardless.SERVING SIZE:At 42g, these cookies are pretty well-sized and will definitely satisfy even the hardiest of sugar seekers. It would take 3 Oreos to match the size of one oatmeal raisin. No contest.TASTE:Dynamite. Sweet cinnamon and raisins definitely prevail in this recipe, giving the oatmeal an authentic, homemade flavor.NUTRITIONAL PROFILE:Now, this is where  loses a few points with me. Though certainly not the unhealthiest cookie out there (in fact, it's probably on the healthier end of the spectrum), there are a few select ingredients that could be avoided, such as corn syrup. But, each cookie does contain 4g of fiber, as well as several grams of healthy fats, and 2g protein! For those who are curious, here's the complete nutrient breakdown:Serving Size: 1 Cookie (42g)Calories: 140Total Fat: 6g (9%)Saturated Fat: 1.5g (8%)Polyunsaturated Fat: 1gMonounsaturated Fat: 3.5gCholesterol: 15mg (5%)Sodium: 150mg (6%)Total Carbohydrate: 27g (9%)Dietary Fiber: 4g (16%)Sugars: 12gOther Carbohydrate: 11gProtein: 2gIngredients: Whole Grain Oat Flour, Enriched Flour (Bleached and Unbleached Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Raisins, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Whole Wheat Flour, Palm and High Oleic Canola Oil (with TBHQ [preservative]), Fructose, Invert Sugar Syrup, Mid-Oleic Sunflower Oil, Raisin Paste, Inulin, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil*, Honey, Brown Sugar Molasses), Dried Eggs, Modified Corn Starch, Corn Syrup, Polydextrose, Leavening Agents (Sodium Bicarbonate, Ammonium Bicarbonate), Oat Fiber, Propylene Glycol Mono- and Diesters of Fat and Fatty Acids, Mono- and Diglycerides, Soy Lecithin, BHT [to preserve freshness], Citric Acid [to preserve freshness], Wheat Gluten, Molasses, Calcium Phosphate, Salt, Natural Flavor, Cinnamon, Allspice, Corn Starch, Enzymes. *Adds a Dietarily Insignificant Amount of Trans FatPACKAGING:Stellar! Each cookie is individually wrapped for easy travel and consumption, so parents can toss one in their kid's lunch box, or tote one to the office for an easy snack/dessert.COST:From what I can tell, the  cookies are about par for the course in terms of cost, neither on the high nor low end, making for a pretty economical choice. Based on Amazon's pricing as I write this, the cost is slightly less than $1.00 per cookie. Not bad!OVERALL:If you're looking to indulge in something sweet, somewhat healthy, and reminds you of a homemade treat, you can't do much better than  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies. The only challenge will be trying to resist a second helping, especially if you still have ice cold milk remaining in your glass."
"Competitors",2022,"My box has an expiration date of September 13, 2012, which is a little bit less than 2 months (which is okay, because the cookies get eaten up fast!). The cookies, made with whole grain  oats, are definitely soft baked, and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite! My only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins, I couldn't taste them! It was practically just an oatmeal taste.Each cookie's size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand. I love that they are individually wrapped because it means I can take them on the go with me! Each cookie is 170 calories, has 1.5 gram of fat, 150mg of sodium, and 12gram of sugar. I don't recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high. This is good as treats for children's lunches though or to have them in your car when ever you go hungry.Also, I dropped one of the cookies (still in the wrapper) on the floor and it did not crumble, which I was happy with."
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are great! They are very soft and have a great flavor. Perfect for taking on the go for the kids."
"Competitors",2021,"I received the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box. Let me just say that it was so yummy and delicious! After sharing it with my kiddos I was left wanting more. I will definitely be keeping these cookies on hand...the whole family loves them!"
"Competitors",2022,"My kids and I absolutely love these cookies, already on our 2nd box!! I am excited to try all the different flavors, good cookies and they are so tasty!! Yum"
"Competitors",2022,"My daughter and I absolutely love theses oatmeal cookies. Has the right amount of sweetness. Very soft not crunchy like most cookies. Taste like what grandma would bake at home."
"Competitors",2021,"I received the  oatmeal raisin cookie as part of my Mom voxbox from Influenster.com. It was the first thing I took out of the box because I was hungry. I was honestly expecting not to like it. When I first opened the bag it smelled very fresh. I took a bite of it and instantly loved it. I loved how fresh, soft and chewy the cookie was. I went out and bought more so my husband can also have some, he also loved them. They are a great on the go snack."
"Competitors",2021,"Good oatmeal cookies.You can pretend you're eating something healthy.  When your marathoner, vegan, 4% body-fat co-worker says, ""Cookies?"" in their smug, disdainful fashion, you can reply, ""No, it's oatmeal"".  Then cram another seven in your mouth, 'cause these are *really* good cookies.E.M. Van Court"
"Competitors",2020,"I love oatmeal cookies!So I decided to try these out.Well I'm a really big fan of these cookies. Their good, tasty, and it's easy to eat when your busy in the morning or you just need a quick snack. You can even heat these up a bit in the microwave or have them cold, it's great either way. But the one complaint I have of these are the raisins, I don't know they just didn't taste that great and they kept getting stuck everywhere my mouth.Glad I tried them though!!"
"Competitors",2021,"Quick Take:it was a C+Usage Tips:good for kids if they come pre-packaged. kids liked it.The Verdict:Didn't quite taste home made. too much molasses? too many carbs.love the commercial of the woman biting the neighbors cookie."
"Competitors",2020,"I Love these cookies , i have had the oatmeal raisin and the chocolate chip ones and cant wait to try them all mmmmmmmmm good !!"
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies were okay. My 2 & 6 year old sisters loved them but I don't think I'd buy them for myself."
"Competitors",2020,"Def love these cookies! I let my kids eat it. I don't feel guilty afterwards! Pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to make them extra soft :)"
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies were delicious! I love that they were individually packed so I could throw a couple in the diaper bag without having to fuss with pre packing snacks in sandwich bags.  The cookies stayed moist and yummy until snack time.  My kid loves it and so do I."
"Competitors",2022,"these cookies are super yummy! I love how they can be a quick, tasty and healthier on the go breakfast option.My whole family loves them!"
"Competitors",2022,"I tried  Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie's as a sample through Influenster.  They were so soft and tasted just like homemade.  It is exactly what I expected from !"
"Competitors",2021,"Three years ago I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. It sucked. There's nothing like bring in the middle of the ravenousness of pregnancy and being told to watch what you eat. But it did get me to start paying better attention to how I could still enjoy foods I loved while making healthier choices. One of the things I learned to balance was fiber intake. Ever since I've made a point to always go for whole grains when the choice is available and 's products tend to make the best of combining deliciousness with heart-healthy oats.I recently received a sample of these Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster and they're surprisingly good. Maybe not quite as good as the ones my mom made when I was a kid but still a tasty treat reminiscent of the childhood classic. Packed with raisins and big enough you only need one they're a satisfying snack or dessert option. Since traditional oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite I'm going to have to try one of their other flavors like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH96""> Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMHBE""> Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Cranberry and Yogurt, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>. With a variety of flavors there's sure to be one for most soft baked style cookie lovers."
"Competitors",2022,"I received a Soft Baked oatmeal cookie in my VoxBox and was very excited to try it. I am always skeptical about the cookies that are advertised as ""soft"". This one truly is. I tried to save some for my husband but it didn't sit there for long. I wish my oatmeal cookies turned out like this!"
"Competitors",2022,"I absolutely love these cookies! They taste just like homemade Oatmeal Raisin cookies that Grandma would make! They are a good sized cookie too, not the teeny tiny ones like most companies make!"
"Competitors",2022," Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are so good! They taste like a homemade cookie! If you want that right out of the oven taste try heating up the cookie for about ten seconds. It will be warm and soft!"
"Competitors",2020,"I received a free  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie from Influenster and it was an instant hit for me. I love this cookie (but of course I share a little piece with with my husband). I could not put the cookie down, it was so good that I went out and bought a box of the almond with chocolate chips. Can't wait to go and buy more."
"Competitors",2021,"I saw these when they first came out so I decided to buy a box. Unfortunately I didn't realize they also make a crunchy version and I grabbed that box by accident. While both are good, I'm a big fan of the chewy cookies. I love oatmeal, but it's not very portable. These are a great cookie to snack on during the mornings or afternoon."
"Competitors",2020,"My son really enjoyed the cookie. He is not a big raisin fan, but the soft oatmeal he liked. I think there was a good amount of raisins in it for the average cookie. I love the single packaging, makes it easy to take a snack on the go."
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are soft and delicious. I am very picky about my oatmeal raisin and  delivered! No Trans Fat is a BIG PLUS!"
"Competitors",2021,"this has got to be one of the yummest cookies i have ever had!!!!they are soft and sweet...my kids ate all of them except for the one i had..."
"Competitors",2021,"This cookie is definitely delicious!  I love the homemade taste and the chewy goodness in every bite! I received this cookie in my Influenster Mom Voxbox so I only got one but I will definitely purchase more oatmeal one's...they are my absolute fav!"
"Competitors",2022,"I am pretty picky when it comes to cookies because I like homemade cookies. I tried the  Oatmeal Raisin cookies and I really liked it. It tasted homemade and was soft and chewy. It was a big hit with my 18 month old too!"
"Competitors",2022,"I tried this cookie and LOVED IT!! I have a four year old who is obsessed with anything sweet(but hey who isnt?) an and she absolutely loved this cookie as well. We will definitely be purchasing this again...Thanks to .com for sending us the sample to try out!!"
"Competitors",2022,"I loved the flavor of the  Soft Baked cookies. They are so soft and chewy. And my grandchildren love them so i always keep a box in the house. I will for sure keep buying these cookies."
"Competitors",2021,"I love oatmeal cookies but not from a package.  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious these are and actually taste home baked!  Good job !"
"Competitors",2021,"This cookie was absolutely delicious. I received it free in my  Mom Voxbox. I only had 1 bite since I shared it with my boys but it that one bite was good enough to tell me it was delicious. It was soft, chewy, satisfying. My kids loved it and wanted more. We have even went and bought some more when we went grocery shopping."
"Competitors",2021,"I loved the chewyness of the cookie. I was initially worried that it would be cloyingly sweet but the oatmeal gave it a lovely texture without adding too much unnecessary sugar. Will definitely purchase this product. Thanks to Influenster I got to try this product for free!"
"Competitors",2021,"The cookie minus the raisins, which I don't care for, were great. Its rather tasty to have such a high nutritional value. I am interested in trying other flavors."
"Competitors",2022,"I got a free cookie, from Influenster.com a few weeks ago, and it didn't make it for much longer than 5 minutes.I opened my box, I got my stuff out, I went to get my camera so I could make an ""unpacking"" video, and when I got back, the cookie was gone, and there was a really guilty looking 5 yr old sitting beside the empty wrapper.So I never got to try it. :( But judging from the satisfied look on my daughter's face, she LOVED it!"
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are great for in the morning when you are in a rush and don't have time to make breakfast they are so tasty! They are even better warmed up. These are also great to keep around for the kids for snack time or to put in there lunch box for school."
"Competitors",2021,"this cookie tastes soo good im really not a fan of raisins but when i tasted this cookie it was like another thing i really recommend it its so good and delicious"
"Competitors",2022,"I received a  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie to test from Influenster via the Mom VoxBox. My 3 year old son loved the cookie - each cookie is pretty large, very soft and full of raisins. If you buy a package of 6, they are individually wrapped which is great for travel. It is great that they are made with whole grain  oats - and that they have a nice helping of raisins. They are still a cookie though and have 12 grams of sugar per cookie. I did buy a box for my son for an occasional treat."
"Competitors",2022,"I recieved one of these to try out in my Influenster Mom Vox Box. I am not a huge raisin fan but I really enjoyed this cookie. So I was happy to see that the cookie didn't have too many raisins in it but enough to get some in every bite and still be able to taste the cookie. Most oatmeal cookies leave a thick,dry feeling in your mouth but nothing like that with this one, perhaps because it was so soft and chewy. They are on my list to buy again. The cookie was super soft, great for my 1 year old to eat. It was also big enough that I could split it between both kids. I would suggest these to anyone looking for a delicious cookie."
"Competitors",2021,"Was fortunate enough to receive this in my mommy Voxbox :) I've tried these delicious cookies before, but it was the first time I had shared one with my son. Needless to say, he loved it. I believe it was good because it somewhat melts in your mouth & is really easy to chew (he's 2) .. I will definitely be repurchasing these for us!!"
"Competitors",2022,"I was able to try this yummy cookie when it came in my momvox and i have to say i don't like raisins but when i took my first bite i was very amazed at how good it tasted i would defiantly buy theses for myself as well as my family"
"Competitors",2021,"I got this cookie as a part of my Mom Box from VoxBox. I'm not too keen on oatmeal cookies, but this one was surprisingly good. I guess I'm more used to them being hard so I really liked the soft chewiness of my cookie. Now a chocolate chip one would be fab!"
"Competitors",2021,"Great brand provides a great cookie.  They are soft and have lots of flavor, definitely worth your money.  I received a sample of this from Influenster and am not a fan of raisins, but I agreed to try and review so I gave it a whirl.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  I can't wait to try other kinds![...]"
"Competitors",2022,"This cookie is so good.  It tasted great.  I ate it faster then I could get it out the box.  I am definately buying more soon!"
"Competitors",2021,"This cookies are amazingly good. I got a free sample in my Mom Vox Box from Influenster and am glad I got to try them out. I'm usually not a fan of oatmeal cookies but these were so soft and moist and had me wanting more. Not only are they good but they're good for you, they're low in fat and high in fiber so they make for a good afternoon snack or evening dessert. I can't wait to go buy more at the store!"

"Competitors",2021," is a trusted brand that has always had great products and this in no different. The cookies are soft , chewy and very fresh. I love that the cookies are individually wrapped for easy snacks or lunches. Its a treat that I feel good giving my family. Will be buying in the future!"
"Competitors",2022,"I received this cookie in my mom voxbox. This cookie was soft and delicious! My kids usually only eat cookies with chocolate chips or M&M's in them, but surprisingly enough, they snatched it from my hands and gobbled it up! I love that it is only 170 calories per cookie, 4 grams of fiber, and 8% iron, making it a good snack. I only wish it had less sugar."
"Competitors",2021,"I tried the best cookie ever from s! I never tasted a soft, fresh cookie like s Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. I was one of the lucky ones to receive a Influenster Mom Voxbox 2012 (complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster). The Voxbox comes with several items and one of the items was a  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie. It tasted like a homemade oatmeal raisin cookie. The raisins, the oats and you could even taste the cinnamon that's in the cookie. It was so delicious, even my kids loved it! I have 4 kids: 2 year old, 3 year old, 6 year old and a 11 year old and they all enjoyed a piece of the cookie. The little ones even started crying when it was all done. So that definitely means I have to go out and buy some more."
"Competitors",2021,"This is going to be the fastest review you have ever read because this is a great cookie.Thoughts: This is a really ez and fast way for you and your kids to snack on the go, a great way to get your fiber, and its for you. The Run Down: If you are a fan of oatmeal cookies then you'll love these. They are soft and chewy like the name says.The Final Say: I have bought them for my family and my little one loves them. We talk them every where. They are about 3$ for a box of 6. All in all i give these 5 (*****). Ill keep buying them for the family. So go get some for yourself!!"
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies are moist just like homemade cookies!!! By far the best store bought cookie and is a must have in any moms pantry!!"
"Competitors",2022,"I received the oatmeal raisin cookie in my momvoxbox from  and it was pleasantly surprised by how chewy and tasty the cookie was considering that oatmeal raisin cookies are usually hard.  I'm not a big fan of the oatmeal raisin cookies but my little brother loved it and i'll most likely purchase the chocolate chip cookies because their a healthier alternative to most i think :)"
"Competitors",2022,"I love oatmeal cookies, but sometimes they tend to be too hard or too dry! Not these!! These are soft and great to give to my toddler when he wants something sweet. I don't like to give him snacks with too much sugar and these are perfect."
"Competitors",2021,"This is not at all what I was expecting, but better! The cookie was so moist and just delicious! Im not a huge fan of raisins, but in all honestly you could not even tell the cookie had raisins, you couldnt even taste them. Absolutley worth the buy, will be purchasing in the future!!"
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies are  baked, mom and kid approved. They are soft, chewy, and most of all delicious. The texture and taste makes them seem homemade without the hassle of baking."
"Competitors",2020,"Great taste and healthy what more could you ask for. Most cookies of this type are dry and make you think you are eating paper but not with  they are soft and moist!"
"Competitors",2021,"These are so good and soft and chewy! The taste is delicious. I tried the Oatmeal raisin cookies and they were delicious. Definitely recommend!"
"Competitors",2020,"This cookie was actually really yummy.  I'm not usually the type of person to like raisins in my cookies, but these were really good and moist. I will definitely be buying these in the future. :)"
"Competitors",2022,"I got to sample this for free. These were soft and delicious. I actually left this partially eaten on the counter overnight and it was still soft the next day when I finished it. Which is good because my kids only half finish what they start eating. I thought it was a great tasting oatmeal cookie - just better without the raisins. I'm not big on them but I was able to pick them out. They need these just in oatmeal with no other ingredient - like raisins added."
"Competitors",2021,"I received this item in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. This cookie was very soft and flavorful. Usually you get cookies like this and they are either hard or dry, and that was not the case with  Brand. I'm not a big fan of raisins but they were fine in this cookie. Just the right amount and not over powering.This is one cookie I would purchase on my own, and I'm sure my son will be very happy about it."
"Competitors",2020,"I received this item for free from Influenster in my mom Vox Box. I am not usually a fan of raisins, but this cookie was soft and tasted just like it was freshly baked. I absolutely loved it."
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are so yummy..They are so soft & don't get stale. I would definitely repurchase these.. I want to try other flavors!"
"Competitors",2021,"I received a sample of your soft baked oatmeal cookies in my Mom VoxBox from .  Within seconds of opening the box my kids were fighting over who would get it!  We all got a taste and it was delicious!  I really liked the flavor and just the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely buy your product again in my local grocery or on amazon."
"Competitors",2022,"I received a  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box.As soon as I opened up the box, the cookie was on top. My 5 year old couldn't wait to get her hands on it.She enjoyed every single morsel. And wanted more. So on my next food shopping day, I will definitely be picking up a box. GREAT JOB QUAKER!"
"Competitors",2022,"I received the Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box and I saw the cookie sitting right on top, so of course I opened it and tried it out! This cookie was so soft and chewy that I am totally buying more as snacks for my little cookie monster!"
"Competitors",2020,"I received a  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box.I opened the box, saw the cookie and ate it right away. I was going to save half for my nephew to try but it was so good I ended up eating both halves any way. Nice and soft and chewy and sooooo yummy. TOTALLY buying more"
"Competitors",2022,"This cookie barely last five minutes in my hands. It was soft & chewy and great on-the-go snack. Its perfect for kids and adults."
"Competitors",2020,"I had the opportunity to try a  Soft Baked  Oatmeal Cookie through Mom VoxBox, and whew was I pleased! I took my sample into work and had it for a snack one night. Soft and with just the right amount of cinnamon in their oatmeal cookie!"
"Competitors",2021,"Normally I'm not a fan of any cookie (other than Oreo) unless its right out of the oven. To me there's just that something extra when it's nice and hot. I took one bit of this thinking I'd be giving the rest of it to my 2 year old daughter. It was DELICIOUS!!! Needless to say, she didn't get any of the cookie. :o) Highly recommend and I will definitely be buying this again!!"
"Competitors",2020,"I am a huge fan of soft cookies so this is top of the line!  I love how soft and flavorful they are.  since they are individually wrapped, it keeps them soft and fresh!"
"Competitors",2020,"I put this is my dad's lunch because he always wants something sweet but I want him to eat healthy. I'm a health-nut & the ingredients in this cookie didn't scare me away. My dad said it tasted home-made (in a good way) & seemed really fresh. The portion size was also good."
"Competitors",2022,"Im not the biggest fan of oatmeal but I really liked this cookie so much that I went and bought a couple boxes!"
"Competitors",2021,"I really liked them they was the best box of cookies I gotten so far I will be getting them again real soon"
"Competitors",2020,"I received a sample of the  Oatmeal cookie in my Influenster voxbox. I'm not a fan of raisins so I let my daughter try it. She loved it. She said she enjoyed the raisins and liked the soft cookie instead of a regular crunchy one."
"Competitors",2020,"The  Cookie, was a great soft cookie to eat. My 3 years old daughter really enjoyed the treat! It was soft, there wasn't any after taste to the cookie.. Just all the yummy goodness.. We tried the Oatmeal raisin cookie and the raisin's were good, they were soft not hard..  Overall I would definitely would buy the  Cookies again.. and would definitely buy another kind other than raisin as well.. I think YOU should try it out. :)"
"Competitors",2021,"When Influenster and  sent me this cookie to try, it looked delicious--but healthy-so you never know!  But, I was delighted because it is good for you and Great Tasting!  Love it!"
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies are great! So yummy! My little boy loved these cookies! Since they are in individual packages, they are great for purses and diaper bags!"
"Competitors",2022,"I thought the cookie was good. It was soft and chewy; however I prefer organic foods and would much  rather have a freshly baked cookie!"
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies were so very scrumptious. They taste homemade and I won't lie... I gobbled it down in mere seconds. I will be purchasing many more."
"Competitors",2022,"Wow, a soft moist & delicious cookie~ has done it again.  Great snack for on the go or to enjoy at home with a nice glass of cold milk. This cookie is large enough to share with two if you have little ones.  The added bonus is its nutritional value!  Grab a box and enjoy!"
"Competitors",2020,"Love the cookies!  I was pleasantly surprised how delicious this was.  I am not usually a soft cookie fan but this one was an exception.  Also, this is a pretty healthy choice if you are craving sweets."
"Competitors",2020,"This cookie was great. It was a little soft, but that's what made it even better. It didn't take long for it to vanish, which might be a bad thing if you lack self control (something I do not possess). I recommend these to everyone unless you are allergic to raisins."
"Competitors",2021,"This cookie is so soft and taste amazing! I was so surprised with how moist and chewy it was, better than home made, believe it or not. My whole family were begging for more, highly recommend trying this!"
"Competitors",2021,"I received this cookie in my Influenster voxbox and LOVED it! It tasted just like what I would make at home. Delicious!"
"Competitors",2020,"I received this cookie from Influenster and  in my Mom VoxBox. I was so excited to get the chance to try this cookie. Then it came and my youngest took it before I got the chance! I was so disappointed but from what I understand from him it is one of the best cookies he has ever had, and it tastes better than the cookies I bake him at home."
"Competitors",2022,"The  Oatmeal cookies are deliciously soft, the cookies are individually wrapped, and I like that because you can take one package on the go and have a good snack a healthy one. I like this Raisins cookies a lot."
"Competitors",2021," Oats Company has been around for over 100 years, and with a track record like that you know that they are doing something right! These soft oatmeal raisin cookies are actually quite good. Each cookie weighs about 1.48 ounces, and is about 170 calories (27 grams of carbohydrates). So, while they are not exactly a low-calorie snack, they aren't too bad either.The nice thing about them is that they are nicely filling, making them a nice afternoon snack, when you need a little something to get you through work. And, while oatmeal raisin cookies are not my favorite snack, I did find these to be quite good. As a matter of fact, that's what I like about them being singly packaged, it keeps me from going back for more!(Review of  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins)"
"Competitors",2021,"No-one should do oatmeal better than  ....right? Well they have been trying to expand from just the basic oatmeal for some time. These soft cookies are tasty and satisfying. In my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear. Weel - they disappeared in swift order. In fact I barely got to taste more than one. The general consensus is these are 'just like homemade. There is not greater compliment that can be paid. They are packaged conveniently for inclusion in school lunches etc. They certainly make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee for that unwinding moment all of us need at somour day."
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are much closer to homemade than most of those break-and-bake cookies out there, with similar nutritional info. Very soft, with lots of plump raisins, great on the go!"
"Competitors",2022,"I like oatmeal and raisin cookies but I don't eat them very often.  That's probably because my wife makes such awesome chocolate cookies.  When I do get an opportunity to try an oatmeal and raisin cookie it is usually from a store-bought package.  I usually come away impressed with how moist these pre-packaged cookies are.  That's what surprised me most about  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie;  They're soft but they aren't moist.  There is a distinct soft dryness to the cookies. The taste was good and my grand daughter quickly ate up most of them.  She liked them because they are tasty and soft.  I agree and I guess two out of three criteria is good but I was looking for one more quality"
"Competitors",2020,"Maybe it was the hot weather? Maybe it was the baking process?These cookies, although individually packed (so good for school lunches), came out a bit dry and crumbly.Sure, maybe I am just a messy eater but a soft baked cookie just not crumble as much as the cookies I got crumbled.Maybe if you get them at the supermarket they would be less dry.Maybe if is just a general problem with the way they are produced."
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies come individually wrapped and easy to stash in lunch boxes, picnic baskets, or give to the kids as an after school snack. However, I did not find them to be the most appetizing thing in the world - especially as an adult who is used to low cal or sugar free snacks. Kids hate them. I couldn't get mine to try more than one bite. Even as an oatmeal cookie, they aren't that good. We found them salty and bland. Yes they were soft, but also crumbly, which made a mess. I wouldn't say they are the worst I've ever tried, be definitely not as good as other  products."
"Competitors",2021,"I really liked these cookies. They are sort of firm but not crunchy, so they don't get crumbs everywhere. They worked really well for me as a post breakfast snack (or sadly even breakfast on some days).  They aren't coated in sugar the way a lot of prepackaged oatmeal cookies are.  Each cookie is individually packaged and is easy to open on the go.I'd totally buy these the next time I see them in the store."
"Competitors",2022," is pretty much the oatmeal company, and they have done a nice job with this oatmeal raisin cookie. I liked the convenience of being individually wrapped, which also preserves its freshness. I take one of these along during a round of golf and in my lunch. The cookie is tasty, light and moist. I recommend this to all cookie lovers, especially those fond of oatmeal raisin."
"Competitors",2020,"These large cookies greatly resemble in look and taste the ones you might get in a vending machine.  They are individually packaged and have a soft and chewy texture.  The taste left me pretty unsatisfied as they were pretty bland and tasted too ""processed,"" not like simple and fresh oatmeal raisin cookies.  I would not recommend them personally, although my little ones liked them fine (although I rarely know kids to say ""no"" to a cookie!)."
"Competitors",2020,"I got to this in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. I don't like oatmeal cookies. So I had my daughter try it and she LOVED it. She said ""Mom, this cookie is really good. Is there another one. I only got one."" I told her no that, that was all. She was really bummed. But I told her that when we go to the store and if we see them we'll make sure to buy them since she likes them so much."
"Competitors",2020,"I was given a chance to sample this cookie when I got my Mom vox box from Influenster and , much thanks. The kids and I shared the cookie it was soft and chewy really good we will be buying them again."
"Competitors",2020,"I was really excited to get this  Soft Baked Cookie in the Oatmeal raisin flavor because this is one of my favorite flavors. Over all the flavor was fabulous with just the right amount of raisins, but I found it to be toooo soft. I do like soft cookies but I had a hard time eating this cookie because it was so soft it crumbled in my fingertips as I tried to take bites so I had to eat it over the wrapper carefully. I also let my 7 year old son and my 12 year old daughter try bites and they loved it and did not care that it was soft and crumbly at all. Overall I would recommend trying them because the flavor is good and maybe they are not all that soft."
"Competitors",2020,"I just wanna say that we are completely hooked on this cookie now! My kids love the product as well! Especially with all the nutritious qualities of the cookie and the great taste! We are def sticking with this from now on!!"
"Competitors",2020,"Love at first bite! Very moist and delicious! Definitely recommend to everyone who is a fan of Oatmeal Raisin cookies."
"Competitors",2020,"I recently tried this product through my  mom vox that I received and I have to admit that I am not a big fan of cookies HOWEVER this has to be the best cookie I've ever tasted thus far so much that I ate the whole thing before I could even record my youtube video, lol."
"Competitors",2020,"This is the best prepackaged cookie I've ever had! They have great flavor, are soft and chewy, and just everything you would expect in a homemade cookie! I was given it in an Influenster voxbox and I can say that I will be purchasing these very often!"
"Competitors",2020,"i actually tried this cookie through  is was really chewy which is how i like my cookies i dont like them hard and crunchy its very good but the after taste left in you mouth is kinda nasty but overall one good cookie"
"Competitors",2021,"I recently tried this cookie as part of an Influenster Mom Vox Box.  Influenster sends out free boxes of products in order for you to test them and give them your feedback. I really enjoyed this cookie!  Most packaged cookies are hard and taste like cardboard but I was pleasantly surprised that this cookie was soft and comparable to a homemade oatmeal raisin cookie.  The nutritional facts weren't too bad for a dessert too.  It was very yummy and filling.  A good sized cookie!  I will definitely be buying some for my family, since I ate this one myself ;)"
"Competitors",2021,"I received a free cookie from Influenster, and it made my week. I normally avoid packaged cookies because I like the chewy freshness of homemade so much better. These had an amazing flavor of cinnamon and spice, and the texture was perfect. I need to go get my own box!"
"Competitors",2022,"I was given a sample of these  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster.com as part of their Mom VoxBox 2012 for reviewing. I shared my cookie with my 2 1/2 year old daughter. As with any cookie, she loved it! I thought the cookie was delicious. Not overly sweet, but had perfect flavor. It was moist too, unlike some cookies that are dry. My least favorite part was how crumbly it was. It did have a tendancy to crumble quite a bit. Overall, it was a great cookie."
"Competitors",2021,"I received this delicious treat complimentary of Influenster in my Mom voxbox. I did note that was in several crumbly pieces when I opened the package, but it obviously didn't change the taste of the cookie itself. It just made it a little messy to eat, but in my house with a toddler that is nothing new. Speaking of toddler, SHE LOVED IT! She actually wanted more after the package was empty, and was pretty upset when I kept telling her it was all gone. :) Looks like we'll be getting some more to have around the house and maybe a little bribery for the diaper bag. :)"
"Competitors",2020,"I got the opportunity to taste test these awesome cookies from Influenster and  in their Mom VoxBox and found the cookie to be absolutely delicious! It was soft and chewy, just how I like my cookies! My four year old and I shared it and half was enough for each of us and he loved it too!"
"Competitors",2020,"I received the  soft baked oatmeal cookies from  in the mombox. I was very pleased. Not only was it a great sized cookie and was also very soft. It was not dry and it tasted great. i will definitely be purchasing this product!"
"Competitors",2020,"I received the Oatmeal cookie complementary in my Influenster Mom Voxbox and I couldn't be more impressed with the quality of the ingredients and the taste! I will definitely be buying more, especially now that I know they come in these amazing flavors!! Yummy! They are great to have on the go and especially delicious warmed up with some milk!!  And they are not too expensive on the calorie bank either!"
"Competitors",2021,"I tried these cookies as a sample from influnster.com. They are a little sweet for my taste, the kids loved it. They are a good size, about the size of the palm of my hand. At 170 calories each, they are a little hefty to have more than one at a time, but since they are individually wrapped, no worries about waste.  Try them microwaved for about 20 seconds!"
"Competitors",2022,"I received a cookie as part of an Influenster review. I love that it tastes like a fresh cookie from Grandma's oven. I knew I would love it, but was uber pleased to see that my 2 year old loves it as well. This is definitely something that will replace a fruit snack!"
"Competitors",2022,"I received a complimentary  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster.com for review purposes. This cookie is huge and hearty! This is literally the first Oatmeal Cookie I have ever been able to get my picky teenage son to eat! Very soft! Just like homemade!  has really outdone themselves!"
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are amazing! They are moist, flavorful and are really satisfying. I can't wait to add them to my teenagers lunches in the fall!"
"Competitors",2020,"These were very tasty, my three year old son even gobbled them up! They are very soft, and as long as you like oatmeal cookies you will love these!"
"Competitors",2022,"For an Oatmeal Raisin cookie this isn't bad at all. Nice and soft, great taste. I like the other flavors of this cookie as well."
"Competitors",2021,"I got a sample of these yummy thangs in my Influenster Mom VoxBox and they are delicious! I shared mine with my toddler and she also loved it, cried when we ran out of cookie! They are nice and soft and really tasty! Go on and get you some, girl!"
"Competitors",2022,"I love  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. They taste so good! They are moist, soft, and just the right size! The first cookie i had i received in my Mom VoxBox from .com. It was so good that the next day I went out and got a whole box! They are great for on the go snacks. I keep one in my purse for when I need a little snack! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KK56JU""> Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies 6 count box (8.8 oz.), Raisins (Pack of 4)</a>"
"Competitors",2020,"I also received a sample of this cookie from Influenster.  My daughter really enjoyed it. I think it is a little high in sugar to make it a regular treat but I would repurchase it in the future."
"Competitors",2020,"The  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are delicious, I received a complimentary sample from Influencers to try the product and review it.  Well when the Vox Box that contained my complimentary products to try I opened it up infront of the mailbox, on the way up my driveway I ate my cookie.  I absolutely love that these are individually packaged yet a nice size cookie.  You don't feel deprived by throwing just one in your lunch box or purse, and certainly the kids love them.  I think they are very reasonably priced, and plan to stock up on a few boxes.  Perfect for the the beach when you want snacks yet don't want the seagulls attacking open food bags.  Not to mention they are a guilt free snack:-Made with Whole Grain  Oats-Individually packaged-Provides a good source of fiber-Contains 6 grams of total fat per servingDefinite buy, if on sale stock up."
"Competitors",2022,"I recieve sample of this cookie from Influenster to try out. I normally dislike cookie with raisins but this one was good. I will not get these again but thats not because it wasn't a good cookie its because of the raisins. I will how ever try these in other flavors."
"Competitors",2021,"I love these cookies. They have a wonderful chewy texture, a bursting with raisins and taste truly homemade. At first I was concerned the cookies may have picked up some of the flavor from the packaging, but the flavor, while helping to maintain the freshness of the cookies, had  no effect on the flavor. I love the baked through flavor of the cookies, they baked to perfection - not underbaked and certainly not overbaked because they are nice and chewy. I will definitely consider these cookies as a pantry item for when I need a treat, but did not have time to  bake cookies for the kids myself.Disclaimer: I received a Mom Voxbox through Influenster, which contained a sample of  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. The opinion expressed herein are my own personal opinion and have not been influenced by Influenster or any other third party."
"Competitors",2021,"I was one of the lucky moms out there that got picked to receive a MomVoxBox  from Influenster. When I opened the box my youngest son Jordan was sitting with me. Before I had a chance to see what it was he took it and ran off. I was surprised by this, but I opened it up for him and he ate it right up. See my son Jordan is Autistic and he is a very picky eater. He is also picky about his snacks. He hates raisins, I have never been able to get him to eat them . But he loved the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. Ever since we received these when he sees a  cookie box we have to buy it he thinks they are the same cookies. These are so great they come in their own wrappers so you can take them when you are on the run and they are way healthier then most cookies out there."
"Competitors",2020,"I received a sample of this product to test from Influenster.  I have been a big fan of oatmeal cookies all my life and I put this right on top.  What really impressed me was the sofeness and the taste was just awesome.  If I didn't know better, I'd think they came right out the oven. Lets not forget the wholesome ingredients it contain.  You couldn't ask for a better cookie.  If I didn't know better, I think my mom made these."
"Competitors",2022,"I received a cookie from Influenster. I am not a big fan of oatmeal and raisin cookies,not since my Granny spoiled my taste buds. Ever since then I have tried to find cookies on the market that were comparable to hers, with no luck. I was surprised by this cookie! It tastes so close to the homemade ones that my Granny used to make!! The size is enormous and the raisins are soft and chewy. Definitely worth buying! LOVE IT!"
"Competitors",2022,"I really dislike oatmeal cookies and raisins..I got a cookie from  and this cookie was awesome and made me change my mind about oatmeal raisin cookies. I would def. get these again."
"Competitors",2020,"I am not a big fan of raisin cookies, But I had a taste of their raisin oatmeal cookies & they were delicious ! I am surprised my son loved them too. He had no clue there were raisins in there, They were just that yummy (: I will def be buying more of these. Thanks to Influester for sending me a sample in my 2012 Mom VoxBox."

"Competitors",2021,"First let me say that I tried this product because I received it in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster as a complementary test product.  That said, these cookies are off the hook delicious.  They really do taste just like homemade (I know, because I make my own all the time).I only ate a bite because my son was chomping at the bit to have it and as soon as his little hands got ahold of this cookie, it was gone in seconds and he was asking for more.  We'll certainly be buying a box to keep for when it's just too hot to turn on the oven and make our own!"
"Competitors",2021,"The  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies were truly much more moist then other brands.  They had a good oatmeal flavor and were packed with raisins, but were not as sweet as I expected.  After a few bites, I found just a little bit of the cookie was the perfect amount to fill me up and calm my sweet tooth.*I received a free sample of this product from VoxBox in order to provide an honest and accurate review."

"Competitors",2020,"These were pretty great. We got the Oatmeal Raisin but to me they tasted like Pumpkin Pie which was even better. My husband and three year old liked them as well. Especially the three year old. These cookies were pretty great. Very dense so one is definitely enough. I want to try another flavor next time too! Maybe something with chocolate!"
"Competitors",2021,"I recently received a sample of this cookie, and I enjoyed it!  The cookie was soft and not too dry.  It was a little spicier than I generally like my oatmeal cookies, but it definitely had some flavor. I wouldn't say that it's my favorite oatmeal cookie ever, but I would be very okay with eating more of them  :)"
"Competitors",2021,"This individually wrapped cookie was moist, soft and chewy. The taste was perfect and it was beyond expectations, the perfect bite."
"Competitors",2021,"Oatmeal is one of my favorite grains and I was very excited to try these cookies, especially a soft variety.  Very yummy!"
"Competitors",2021,"The oatmeal cookie was so soft and chewy. It really was very yummy as well as healthy. Will definitely buy more!"
"Competitors",2022,"Upon recieving this cookie in my voxbox from  I sceptical because you expect cookies in a package to be very dry and more often than not tasteless, the cookie recieved in the package was surprisingly moist and very flavorful, it tasted very good and I will definately purchase them in the future."
"Competitors",2022,"My daughter and I tried the soft baked oatmeal cookies and we both agreed it's delicious!  I rarely purchase premade cookies, because they are too hard for my preference, but this changes my mind.  They are full of flavor.  The oatmeal doesn't overpower the raisins and the raisins don't overpower the oatmeal, it's a perfect balance.  The raisin were soft, not hard like other brands we've tried in the past.  The price for the quality is well worth it."
"Competitors",2022,"I absolutely fell in love with these cookies.  I love my cookies soft and not hard, unless it's an Oreo and then I soften it in milk, but these cookies are hands down the closest I've had to homemade!"
"Competitors",2022,"Less calories than a candy bar! I will take it. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the cookie. I thought it wouldn't have much flavor but it does. The spice of the cookie and the raisins make it a delicious treat. Now it is a soft baked cookie but to me it was a tad bit dry. It was still edible and good. I will pick up a box once they are available."
"Competitors",2022,"Got a free sample cookie from @'s Mom voxbox. These cookies are great they are soft and chewy and left me wanting more!"
"Competitors",2020,"I was given a sample of the  Chewy oatmeal cookie from Influenster. I enjoyed the taste and texture of my cookie. I will buy them again if they are on sale or I have a coupon to use."
"Competitors",2020,"Greta cookies and amazing nutrition in them. Would definitely purchase this product. ,y favorite part was the delicious oatmeal put in them."
"Competitors",2022,"I received these cookies to try from Influenster and they were delicious! So soft and yummy and not too small like some store bought cookies are. They tasted homemade and the whole family loved them!"
"Competitors",2022,"liked the flavor just wished it had more oatmeal in the cookie. But i do like how soft it was!!"
"Competitors",2022,"I loved the softness of this cookie but not to keen on oatmeal but I will be buying more of these just not in that flavor. my kids loved the cookie!"
"Competitors",2022,"I've always on the lookout for handy snacks for my teenage son.  he loves soft cookies, so I was thrilled to see the soft baked oatmeal cookie from the masters of oatmeal.  My expectations were high.This is a good cookie, but not a great one, so I was a little disappointed.  The consistency is excellent, just what you would want from a soft baked cookie.  And it is defintely enough for a snack - at 1.48 oz and 170 calories - that's plenty. The raisins, too were outstanding. But the cookie itself was not great tasting. I wanted bigger hunks of oatmeal-- more texture, and there was an aftertaste of the preservatives."
"Competitors",2020,"The Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade.  They are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt (which is exactly how I like my cookies).  And even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  And there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.  On the flip side, the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that I cannot pronounce (is a red flag for me)."
"Competitors",2021,"Nice flavor, and only 70 calories per cookie; the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are tasty.  But they're just not something to get overly excited about.  If oatmeal cookies are your definition of snacking nirvana, you might find these well worth trying."
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies were a hit with everyone in our family from the oldest (35) to the youngest (17 months.)  The cookies were very soft and tasty.  Each cookie was full of raisins, and still retained an ""oatmeal"" taste.  They are sized perfectly, one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box.  My only complaint is that they were crumbly.  This was fine for my 17 month old twins, as they still don't have all of their teeth, and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies.  I had a problem with the crumbly texture, because when I tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk, a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass, where it turned into inedible mush.  Aside from that one complaint, I have nothing bad to say about these yummy cookies."
"Competitors",2021,"These are delicious, no question. They seem to have achieve the perfect level of sweetness, unlike most cookies with are a lot more sugary tasting. Kudos.There are also plenty of raisins, so at least part of its sweetness comes from a more natural source.My only complaint is the cookies were surprisingly dry. They are very well packaged, so I don't think that was the problem. Maybe they're made that way. But I've also heard that some products aren't great to order by mail in hot summer months, as they may dry out. I know mine probably spent at least a few hours on the porch in 90 degree weather. Dunking the cookie in tea or milk, or microwaving them for 15 seconds helped a lot.Otherwise, these were yummy and seem more healthy than other choices."
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are pretty good.  They are soft and flavorful.  They are not amazing or as good as homemade, but what packaged cookie is?  These are better than other packaged cookies we've tried, and the nutrition information isn't horrible either."
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies are soft, but not crumbly like so many mass-produced ""soft"" cookies.  They have a good amount of raisins and slight oatmeal-spice flavor.  A plus is the individual wrappings, good for taking on an outing, packing in school lunches or even selling at a bake sale.  Don't expect the same chewiness or intensity of oat flavor as bakery or homemade cookies, but as store shelf cookies go, I've had worse (Chips  ""chewy gooey"" for instance)."
"Competitors",2022,"These are pretty tasteless, and the texture is all wrong.An oatmeal cookie should have a good texture, you should bite into something a little crunchy.  While I understand these are ""soft-baked"", I still expected to have some differentiation between the outer edges and the inside of the cookie.  There was none. They just don't taste that good.I ate one, my husband ate one, and the rest are still sitting in a box on the counter."
"Competitors",2022,"I did not love the taste or texture of this cookie. It is somehow simultaneously soft and dry  and gritty. The taste is nothing remarkable. And, it is not particularly healthy- not bad, but the stats arent great for one small-ish cookie.Give it a try, you may like it, but I was disappointed. I recommend Bel Vita Biscuits as a healthier- and tastier- cookie alternative."
"Competitors",2021," cookies have always been one of my favorites and these do not disapoint. These cookies are so delicious! They are soft and chewy and scrumptious. My kids love them, I love them, this is definitely on my shopping list :)"
"Competitors",2021,"I received a complimentary sample from Influenster to try the  cookie.  It was soft and amazingly delicious.  My daughter loved it as well.  Will definatly be purchasing these in the future."
"Competitors",2021,"I received this Oatmeal raisin cookie from  and they were so delicious! They were soft and moist and I will definitely get these in the future for my family!"
"Competitors",2021,"I received a sample of this cookie and oh my goodness it didn't let me down.  It was delicious and tastes a lot like a homemade cookie you'd make yourself!  I loved how soft it was as I prefer soft over crunchy cookies.  I'm definitely interested in checking out the different flavors they offer."
"Competitors",2020,"We LOVE  Soft Baked Cookies in our house hold! They have great for everyone. My sons first cookie was a Wuaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie that I got in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster. Will be buying alot of these!"
"Competitors",2021,"I got a sample of this cookie from Influenster.  I just have to say it was soooooooo delicious.  I love oatmeal cookies and even though I always use  oats they never come out as soft and delicious as this cookie was.  Forget baking, I'm buying from now onw."
"Competitors",2022,"I received this cookie from Influenster to try and review. Mine was raisin flavored and It was yummy! I would recommend this cookie based on price , easiness to find and purchase, and flavor/ softness! As close to homemade as you can get without the work! And reasonably healthy as well! yummy!"
"Competitors",2021,"I loved the  Soft Baked oatmeal cookie that I got to test recently! The spices in the cookie were perfect, and the flavor was better than homemade! I'm not an Oatmeal raisin cookie eater, but this was a soft and Delish cookie that I truly enjoyed!"
"Competitors",2022,"I recieved this cookie sample  complimentary for testing and review from Influenster.I let my neighborhood kids test this out. (see pictures below) .  It was easy for them to open and they loved the cookie itself.  They asked me to go buy them some for snacks.  Here is the information about the cookie"
"Competitors",2021,"This was one of the best soft cookies I've had in a while that was store brought. I am not a big fan of raisins but this cookie made me forget all about them. If you are thinking about buying these, they are a good buy. A Great snack for Adults and children."
"Competitors",2022,"I was desperate for something to eat but had to rush rush rush out of the house for a family emergency.  I hadn't eaten lunch yet so I grabbed one of these cookies and headed out the door.  As I drove to pick my son up from school, I ate the cookie and was surprised at how satisfied I was.  No more growling or stomach pains.  And the fullness lasted until dinner!"
"Competitors",2022,"These  cookies are so great, they are easy to carry around and they make a great snack when you are on the run."
"Competitors",2022,"I received a sample of the  oatmeal raisin soft baked cookies (courtesy of Influenster.com) about a month ago and since then I haven't purchased any other oatmeal cookie. I love them and most important my daughter loves them. These make the perfect snack for lunch, at day at the park or beach, or a midnight snack. Best part is they are healthy and don't make you feel bad for ""cheating"" a little on your diet. There's so much to say but to sum it all up....they are DELICIOUS!!!"
"Competitors",2020,"I received one of these cookies as a sample in the Influenster Mom VoxBox. I didn't think I'd like it because I'm not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies. The plan was to give it to my husband who loves them. Well, before he could get it, my daughter snatched it up. She doesn't like raisins but loved this cookie! I talked her into giving me a bite and it was really good! It was really soft, not dry. I have been trying to find them in the store to buy some more but so far haven't had any luck."
"Competitors",2022,"I received a sample of these in my summer mom voxbox from  and as soon as we opened it everyone wanted a piece and we had to share! One cookie just wasn't enough...I'll have to buy more..they were so soft and tasted like it was freshly baked..not overly sweet and the raisins were plump and soft...highly recommend!"
"Competitors",2021,"I recieved this cookie in my Influenster Momvoxbox. We recieved the Oatmeal Raisin cookie. It was so soft and tasted sooo good. There was only one so my kids and I had to share. Later that afternoon I went out and bought the Oatmeal Raisin and the Banana Nut. Love them!"
"Competitors",2022,"Let me just say wow!  I was a little apprehensive at first because prepackaged cookies are never as soft and chewy as advertised but these s cookies were amazing they were soft, chewy and tasted like they were baked fresh.  I will be recommending these to everyone i know"
"Competitors",2022,"I loved this cookie! It was soft and very good! It didnt taste like all those other prepackaged cookies with that chemical aftertaste. I bought a box yesterday!"

"Competitors",2022,"I hope they make chocolate chip next!! These cookies are wonderful!! Fresh, taste homemade better than any other store bought cookie!"
"Competitors",2021,"I was worried that these were going to be dry and not as ""soft"" as some cookies claim to be, but these were amazing. there was a great cinnamon taste that reminded me of fresh baked cookies, and I honestly was not expecting them to be so good! I have forced many of my friends and family to try them, and they love them as well!!!if you love oatmeal raisin cookies..you will LOVE these!"
"Competitors",2022,"My daughter ate this cookie and loved it.  She stated that it was soft and moist and not too sweet.  My baby also liked this cookie, his review was a little more understated though.  He cooed and smiled and tried to steal more from his sister.  I will definitely be purchasing this product in my normal grocery-shopping routine. I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster. @ #softbaked @"
"Competitors",2022,"I really liked the cookies. My daughter loves the as well as a special to treat to share with me. A little crumbly but that what you get for a real soft and moist cookie and not one chocked full of chemicals to keep cookies fake,y moist and chewy."

"Competitors",2021,"I don't care for oatmeal cookies + I was actually going to give this to my husband. I kind of feel guilty that I didn't lol. But it was really soft + yummy. Making me reconsider only keeping stock in chocolate chip cookies."
"Competitors",2021,"I gave this product 4 stars because of it's usefulness to me. The kids LOVED it and they're not huge fans of oatmeal cookies! I thought it was tasty; however, I'm not likely to purchase it with frequency because I try to avoid packaged foods, and do not store a lot of sweets in the house for the kids. I would however choose this over the competition. (I got this product as a free trial from .com)"
"Competitors",2021,"i love this cookie it was so soft and chewy and oh so yummy!!! not a fan of raisins but the cookie was goood and my husband loved it"

"Competitors",2022,"I received a  soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie from Influenster to try and review. I shared this with my son who does not like oatmeal and he loved it! I love that it is made with whole grains and could be a good substitute for an on the go breakfast when I am running behind. The flavoe is very good, I love the soft texture, I really don't care for hard cookies and this one is perfect. I would recomeend this product to others and will probably purchase some more for my family."
"Competitors",2022,"These are the most amazing cookie EVER!  I had mine a bit warm from the sun and it was like rite out of the over goodness!  Heaven in a baggie!"

"Competitors",2020,"So, I got a sample of this product in the mail.Just opened the box and the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie, was gone. My son eat almost all and i just try a little bit. When he finished all star to cry and i have to buy some more at the store. now this is a family favorite to eat with milk. Its so soft like cake, i love it, and so healthly to my kids. Try one, you dont regret it!"
"Competitors",2022,"So, I got a sample of this product in the mail. After a few hours I thought well maybe I'll try it and it just happened to be the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie, but the cookie was gone. My daughter just happened to ""go missing"" around the same time, and she's a mommy's girl and never leaves my side. So as I'm searching for her, I find her in my bathroom shower with the cookie almost ate up. I would have gave it to her anyway if she asked, but she hit it from me and ate it all herself! My daughter is extremely finicky when it comes to snacks, but this she gobbled right up. A cookie you can't go wrong with and good for them too!"

"Competitors",2020,"I am not crazy about cookies to begin with. I do however prefer Oatmeal Raisin than any other kind. I like my cookies well done and toasty, whereas these are super soft. They do taste great but just not my preference. My son loved it :D"
"Competitors",2022,"these are the BEST single serve cookies i have EVER had !! i have had other brands that were just had a wierd after taste i think because of the packeging, but these did not have that taste, all you taste is the amazing cookie"

"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are absolutely delicious, I received one for review purposes from Influenster.com. I took a bite and gave the rest to my son, which was gone before I even had a chance to change my mind. LOL One of the moistest, most delicious cookies I have ever had, hands down. The only drawback that I found was that my cookies was broken into about 5 pieces, not sure what happened, but that doesn't effect the flavor!"
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are so good. They taste homemade! Very tasty and healthy! Usually I only think oatmeal when I think of ...I was wrong!I got a free sample from Influenster! :)  I will be buying for sure!"
"Competitors",2022,"When I tried the cookie I noticed that it was very soft, moist, and chewy. I usually do not like raisins, but they were very good in this. They actually tasted like homemade to me. And I grew up with a grandmother who always had fresh baked cookies in the kitchen. Having three kids of my own, of course I had to share with them. My son's comment on the cookie was, ""That's really yummy, Mommy!"" I am pretty sure we will be purchasing these in the future because my two boys keep asking if there is another cookie in my VoxBox.I received a sample of the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie with Raisins in my MomVoxBox from Influenster for review purposes only. All opinions are my own."
"Competitors",2021,"This cookie is so good, I received a sample from Influenster and when I opened it, it smelled like a homemade cookie...it tastes so fresh and it is filling, you only need one and you are good to go! I will be buying these in the future!"
"Competitors",2021,"Was very happy when I received the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster to try! I had seen them on commercials but never remembered to buy them when we went to the market, but I will definitely remember to buy them now!! What a delicious cookie and it is good for you too! Me and my son enjoyed our cookie with our lunch and it was a hit with both of us. It was such a soft and flavorful cookie that filled you up and left you satisfied. I will definitely be trying other varieties of the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies and will be recommending them to hall my friends!"
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies are very good. My daughter tried the sample and then I went out and bought a box. The whole family loves them. They are very soft and moist. It is a new snack in our household!"

"Competitors",2021,"I received 's Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie as a sample in the mail. The cookie is really soft and a very nice size. The raisins taste very fresh and it's just like eating a freshly baked cookie; you could even put in the microwave for a bit to get the fresh oven baked feel."
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies are very delicious! They are nice and soft so i could even give them to my 2 year old."
"Competitors",2021,"This morning I gave my son a  oats rasin cookie for breakfast. When we took it out of the package it smelled amazing. I wish I was able to try this with him, but I have celiac and am gluten free. However my one year old son gobbled it up. It was super soft and chewy. There were visible oats and lots of rasins. I like that they were healthy. I did not mind giving this for breakfast as a treat because they are  oats!"
"Competitors",2022,"I don't usually like Oatmeal Raisin cookies, but when Influenster sent me this cookie to try, I did, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I loved it! So great, so soft, and so delicious. I definitely recommend that everyone try this cookie."
"Competitors",2021,"I received this  Soft Baked cookie from Influenster. This was my first time trying it and ohhh my!! It was fresh tasting. Very chewy and busting with flavor."
"Competitors",2021,"I love these cookies!!!! They are very soft and actually taste like the homemade cookies your grandma would bake. Which is a great compliment to  considering I think my Grandma is the best cookie baker ever! I also like that the cookies are a good snack that are not super high in calories. I will for sure be buying these cookies again and recommending them to all of my friends."
"Competitors",2020,"I received this from Influenster in the Mom Voxbox. When I offered to my kids to try the  Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookie I literally had a crying baby on my hands. She did NOT want anyone to eat any of the cookies she says ""I's MINE!"" Even getting a new box ""It's mine"" have to hide it.  Thanks!! Annette G"
"Competitors",2020,"I know they say ""soft baked"" but how often is a packaged cookie really all that soft? Well, these are super soft!  The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was that the cookie was so soft and moist that it broke apart with little to no effort.  I shared the cookie with my preschool daughter.  We both loved the taste.  I'm not usually an oatmeal cookie fan, but I really liked this cookie.  My daughter asked me to buy her more of them.  That in itself makes it a winner, ha!  These are great cookies and will become a staple in my pantry."
"Competitors",2022,"These were great! These cookies were soft and very tasty, almost like fresh baked.  They were much larger than I expected. Great product, you won't be disappointed."
"Competitors",2020,"This cookie was so soft, and delicious. I definitely plan on buying more! Perfect snack to have on the go or just at home with a glass of milk."
"Competitors",2021,"The cookie is amazing, very soft. My daughters ages 4 years old and 10 months couldn't resist them. I had to buy another box right away."
"Competitors",2020,"The  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, is a great tasting snack that gives you that full feeling. Just 2 of these cookies gives you that satisfying full feeling. Since it is made out of oatmeal and raisins, we could classify it as a healthy snack. But on the nutritional breakdown, would be better if this snack would go down on a less than 5mg cholesterol. The per serving content of cholesterol is 15mg, sugar is 12g, so as with any other food, moderation is the key. Nevertheless, anything oatmeal gives you a great start on eating, whether to maintain a healthy lifestyle or starting one."
"Competitors",2020,"Chewy, sweet goodness. These cookies are right up my alley. I even liked that they were individually packaged--great for lunch boxes or for keeping cookie monsters from devouring the entire package in one sitting. The individual cookies weren't huge but they were big and chewy enough to satisfy a sweet tooth with just one package. They weren't overly sweet or overloaded with raisins--someone must have studied the cookie-to-raisin ratio and came up with the perfect number. I'll definitely much on these again."
"Competitors",2020,"This is an interesting product - the texture is immediately attractive and quite remarkable given that it is a packaged product, but the flavor is not quite right. There is a sense of artificiality about the flavor that may come from preservatives or flavoring additives. My family ate all the samples we received, but there was no real drive to go out and buy a box, even among my otherwise enthusiastic cookie-eating teens.  I think that the product needs a trip back to the drawing board if the goal is authentic oatmeal cookie taste and not just texture.  Sorry!"
"Competitors",2020,"As a lover of oatmeal cookies since the days of being a kid, I was anxious to try these from such a well known brand.  I have always been someone that sticks to either cheaper brands, or the kind of cookies that are made in a markets own bakery.  Personally I think the latter are the best there is in most cases as far as store bought is concerned..  As for these  cookies I found them to be just average in taste.  The box I got held very fresh cookies individually wrapped that were satisfying in flavor, but not at all anything special.  Personally I don't think the heavier cost of these are worth it for just being a famous brand.  You can do at least just as good with other store bought brands, and much better in my opinion in buying your local markets cookies.  On the other hand if you happen to be a big fan  Oats cookies, or just enjoy the particular flavor of these, buying them here in the big 12 pack is not a bad deal at all.  The cost is enough to get you the free shipping, and the convenience along with the reasonable price makes it a sold deal.  Enjoy if these are your favor.. : )"
"Competitors",2021," soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins taste pretty darn good. The only draw back are they're too dry. Still, much better than many other similar cookies made by other companies, some who make their products even drier and why sweeter. Still, with a cup of tea or coffee they make a pretty good snack or bit of an after dinner treat. I was disappointed when I reached into the box for a cookie after lunch and realized I'd already eaten them all!"
"Competitors",2020,"I'm always on the look-out for a good tasting, individually wrapped, healthy snack that I can toss in my bag for a quick bite. Oatmeal cookies are one of my favorites so I gave these a try.The packaging is fine but the cookie does not have a very good taste. It has a dry texture to it, not very oat-like at all. They are soft, but not moist. There were plenty of raisens but not enough spice for my taste. On the positive side, they do contain more fiber than most cookies, but at 170 calories each, they are a little fattening."
"Competitors",2020,"I tried one: gave it two bites (to be sure) and then into the trash. Not even close to appetizing. It's amazing, how can something be chewy and yet powdery dry and quite tasteless simultaneously? 's R&D figured out the conundrum and produced these ""cookies"". I assume it's the oat bran since I had similar experiences with using it when it was THE thing to do (e.g., pancakes). However, what ever it is, it ain't good! I do not recommend these, not even to my sworn enemies!"
"Competitors",2021,"This is a pretty good cookie in terms of taste / flavor, but as cookies go I will say it was a little dry with the actual cookie part and not as moist as I like with oatmeal cookies (the raisins were moist).  Each cookie is individually wrapped vs. opening up a whole box which makes for a good snack to take the edge off of your day.Each cookie is 170 calories with 6 grams of fat (9% of recommended daily value) and 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the recommended daily value), so I really don't want to eat more than one a day!"
"Competitors",2021,"First of all, I like that the cookies are individually wrapped. I can grab one and stick it in my pocket on my way out the door in the morning.The cookies themselves are big and a good thickness. They are soft with out being crumbly. The promised raisins are mostly small bits of chopped raisins and don't really add to the flavor of the cookie. I would have like whole raisins. The taste is mostly oatmeal with just the right amount of cinnamon. They are also dry. You really need an accompanying beverage with these. They are hearty enough that one makes a good snack.While I would never mistake these for Mom's oatmeal cookies (or mine for that matter) they're not too bad for ""store-bought."" If you like oatmeal cookies, give these a try. Just have a drink ready, too."
"Competitors",2020,"I am kind of shocked that these cookies were too sweet since I have really enjoyed how  can make food be sweet but not too sweet. These are all individually wrapped, which is easy for on the go and keeps the cookies extra fresh. Each cookie is a decent size and we ate these over a week and it kept its softness.For me, it was a bit too sweet and I am a big sweet eater. I actually don't taste the oatmeal as much and more of the raisins, which could be why it was just so sweet to me.It was still yummy and I would get it again but only if I am in a really sweet mood."
"Competitors",2020,"I loved these cookies! My daughter eat them right up. They are soft and taste great. I like softer cookies and this one was a hit with my whole family."
"Competitors",2021,"Chock full of sugar!  Absolutely not something I would serve to my family.  Obviously, all cookies have sugar in them, but these seem to be a bit excessive."
"Competitors",2020,"I recently received the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie as a part of my Mom VoxBox from Influenster.  I was a little apprehensive giving the cookie to my own two ""cookie monsters"" because they have not been big raisin fans, but they LOVED it!  The texture is so soft and chewy that they gobbled it up and asked for more!  They never even noticed the raisins!  I will buy these again as a special treat for them :)"
"Competitors",2021,"I got these in the Mom VoxBox from Influenster, and was excited to try them!They are chewy and delish! I can see these disappearing and having an empty box sitting around!I'm not a fan of hard crunchy type cookies, so these were right up my alley!"
"Competitors",2022,"My 3 1/2 year old loved this cookie!  We shared it and I'm pretty sure he would have eaten the whole thing!  Very soft and th perfect amount of sweetness- not overly sweet like some oatmeal cookies tend to be."
"Competitors",2022,"Very soft and chewy! Love the homestyle taste of the cookie and that it is very nutrious! Definetly gotta get some more!"
"Competitors",2022,"Well, let me start by saying these cookies are very soft and moist. However, I did not really like them. They were not sweet (which is a matter of personal preference) and they had a gritty texture to them."
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are delicious. They are full of flavor and taste moist and fresh. My kids loved them!!! My expectations were exceeded!"
"Competitors",2022,"This cookie is one of the best cookies that i have tried in a while since i do not like the hard crunchy ones like chips  because it is so soft to the bite and pulls you in to make you want more. You can taste all the ingredents none are hidden and has a good amount of raisins in the cookie. I will be buying these for my family as long as they make them."
"Competitors",2022," Soft Baked cookie taste homemade, I like that is made with whole grains, low calorie & just healthy yummy goodness that everyone in the family can enjoy. I feel good about buying this because the ingredients are simple & I have used  for years. Is a much better alternative than the other regular cookies you see in the store. Packed with raisins & whole grains. Great to pack, on road trips or just in your purse. Kid tested and approved! I received this product complimentary to test through Influenster's VoxBox program."
"Competitors",2022,"I have absolutely fallen in love with the soft baked cookies! My kids love them, and I love them as a treat to munch on. However, they also can be used in delicious cookie crusts or cookie crumbles for recipes! They are so versatile and delicious! I definitely recommend them to everyone! my husband isn't even an oatmeal fan, but LOVES these cookies!!"
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies are to die for. I ate mine in a matter of seconds and was ready for the next one, but I only had one. I recommend these cookies for anyone kids, adults and the elderly. Its deliciously soft packed with raisins and yumminess!! Go to the store now and buy them, you sure wont be disappointed."
"Competitors",2020,"These are soft, chewy, and delicious! They really do taste just like homemade cookies... with natural ingredients. They are a perfect treat, but still feel like a bit of a healthy snack as well.* I  received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster"
"Competitors",2021,"I let me daughter try some and I ate the rest. She isn't big on raisins but it was still good to her. I thought it was delicious because it was soft and tasted like it was just baked from the oven. I would highly recommend it and who doesn't love a good homemade cookie. Cause that's what it felt like to me. Like someone had just gave me a freshly baked cookie."
"Competitors",2020,"This product was provided to me for free through Influenster. My family love these cookies. They are soft and slightly chewy. My 2 yr old will only eat these oatmeal cookies. So he really enjoyed them."
"Competitors",2020,"I received this through  mom voxbox.  My children loved it and I felt great knowing that it is a healthier cookie than others on the market."
"Competitors",2020,"i received a sample of the  soft baked oatmeal cookie through .  the cookie was quite large and was filling.  it satisfied my craving for a sweet without too many calories."
"Competitors",2021,"I received a sample of the oatmeal cookies through Influenster, it was a large size cookie so I decided to split it with my husband and my 5 year old son, I didn't think my son would eat it but after his piece was gone he asked for more! Even my husband thought it was great and he does not really like oatmeal cookies. I will buy these now!"
"Competitors",2022,"I recently received a sample of this  Oatmeal cookie in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster and I couldn't put it down.  The cookie is a nice big size and is full of flavor. Its not overly sweet and has that homebaked taste to it.  I can't wait to get more."
"Competitors",2020,"I received one of these to try for free and review from Influenster in my mom Voxbox and I have to say, it was the softest, chewiest cookie I've ever had. This is saying a lot since I'm picky about cookies being soft and chewy. I'm anxious to try the other flavors. Especially the Apple Cinnamon one! Yum!"
"Competitors",2020,"I received a sample of this product from Influenster.com. They were delicious cookies I have to say. I don't usally reach for oatmeal cookies they are just not my favorite or my son's favorite. I love how homemade they taste. Nice and soft real taste of oatmeal and raisins. I will definetly continue buying some of these especially because enjoyed them!."
"Competitors",2021,"These are SO yummy! They are incredibly soft and take me back to my childhood when my grandma would make oatmeal raisin cookies. My toddler loves them too!"
"Competitors",2020,"I have always loved  brand products.  I had recieved a Oatmeal Rasin cookie through @ to try and review.  My boys actually were going to fight over who got to eat the cookie so I did the old one kid break it in half and the other one choose what half he wants trick.  They were left wanting more!  I have already repurchased these cookies several times in different flavors.  I am happy that they are good for them and make a great snack."

It's very soft, delicious, and taste like it was homemade. After tasting it, I went out and bought a few boxes for my family and I to enjoy."
"Competitors",2020,"If you like soft cookies, then these are for you. Great ""healthy"" snack! Don't  leave 'em in your gym bag though, you'll have a bag of good tasting crumbs!"
"Competitors",2020,"I really loved this cookie. The calories in it are not bad and the taste is great. I am always looking for a quick on the go breakfast and this hits the nail on the head. It would go amazingly with a cup of coffee. The cookie was soft and full of flavor. The only thing that I didn't love was it kind of had a salty after taste. If the sodium could be reduced just a smidgen then it would be the best cookie I have ever tasted. I would buy these if our commissary would carry them!"
"Competitors",2021,"I got a free sample via , I'm not gonna lie the  cookie was the first thing that caught my eye. First of its was so soft & chewy its just melts in your mouth. I definetly stocked up on the cookies. I tried the oatmeal cookie & its still my fav!!"

"Competitors",2020,"Got a free sample via Influenster of the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisin flavor.  First, it soft and crumbly. Secondly, it has a strong cinnamon flavor.  Thirdly, the raisins are actually good and add some texture. If you like oatmeal cookies, you will like this product."
"Competitors",2021,"I've had other store bought cookies, these are better quality - more deluxe. I buy and bake a lot of gluten free for my son, so this was a real treat and just for me! A great snack for on the go."
"Competitors",2020,"I really liked this cookie. It was very soft and chewy just how I like my cookies. The only problem was it could have been sweeter, maybe with some chocolate chips in with the raisins it would have been even better. I think for a quick breakfast great choice, not so much as a sweet though."
"Competitors",2021,"I tried the raisin oatmeal cookies and they are so soft!  I am not a raisin fan but I still loved these and think they taste homemade!"
"Competitors",2020,"I received a complimentary sample of this cookie from  via Influenster's MomVoxBox. I'm not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies but when I tasted these it was really good. It's soft and delicious! I am now a fan and will be buying these for sure!"
"Competitors",2022,"I received a complimentary sample of this cookie from  via Influenster's MomVoxBox and my husband loves Oatmeal Raisin cookies when he grabbed a hold on mine it was over he devoured it ans said this was the best Oatmeal Raisin cookie he ever tasted so I was pretty sad he didn't share so I went out the next day and purchased my unknown box and almost ate the entire box on my drive back home, they were absolutely delicious tasted so fresh and homemade like full of flavor."
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are so good that i eat them as a snack for when i am at work and they are simply the best. Love how they are soft and taste so good."
"Competitors",2021," Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are better than any homemade cookies I have tried or made. Which says alot considering I'm a former baker. They are so soft and tasty, even my 8 year loved this cookie and she hates oatmeal. I highly recommend these cookies. They're especially great for on the go snacks.Also the price is very reasonable considering the quality you get. So if you're a cookie fan this one you have to try, you won't be disappointed."

"Competitors",2020,"I had received a free sample cookie of the soft baked  oatmeal cookie in raisins and my 6 yr old asked if he could have it. I told him he would have to share them with me. I was lucky I got a bite of it as he woofed that cookie down!lol It's on our next shopping list so I can get a box of my own! :)"

"Competitors",2022,"These cookies are amazing! I got one from Influenster to review in my Mom VoxBox and my daughter loved it...  Soooo much that I bought 3 boxes at the store the next day! We have now tried the Apple Cinnamon, Oatmeal Raisin, and Banana Nut and can't decide which one we like more :)"
"Competitors",2022,"My kids and grandkids absolutely love these soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies.  I thought maybe they wouldn't like them because of the raisins, but I don't think they even noticed them as they scarfed their way through the cookies.  I was able to get in a bit or two before they got ahold of them, and I agree, very good cookies!"
"Competitors",2021,"Soft Cookie, if you didn't unwrap yourself you would swear your grandma baked them...my girls are not oatmeal raisin fans, but they fight over my  soft baked cookies, I keep these in my cubicle, they are my go to snack, if I had a nasty client I'll pop one in my mouth and take a time out. I am a big cookie fan and I like that these are individually wrapped and will stay fresh until I need one. I original received a sample from  website but have since purchased them since my girls ate my original  provided cookie."
"Competitors",2022,"These are wonderful. I love love love soft cookies, and oatmeal raisin are my favorite! I mostly make my own cookies, but I would definitely purchase these! I got them compliments of Influenster &  to test out, and my son & I love them!"

It has the best homemade taste. I love how it's super soft and just crumbles in your mouth and melts. BEST cookie ever!"
"Competitors",2022,"I received this product from  and i loved the oatmeal cookie type! They are perfect on the go and i just HAD to buy a box at the store when i saw them. They were gone in 2 DAYS!!! They are perfect for that sweet late night snack and even as a on the run breakfast! 5 stars!"

"Competitors",2021,"This is and amazing cookie! I received the Raisin cookie to try through  and was pleasantly surprised by its taste and texture. It truly is a very soft cookie and has a bold taste. Me and my two year old devoured this cookie then whet out to buy more! Would defiantly recommend."
"Competitors",2020,"I really like these cookies. I am not a huge fan of raisins but these are so good. Nice and soft!"

"Competitors",2021,"I love chewy cookies! And these are definitely chewy. I love it. But the downside is that it's made in a place that manufactures peanuts. My Bubs is allergic to peanuts. =\ So, he couldn't have any."
"Competitors",2020,"I received this cookie courtesy of , my family loves oatmeal cookies, and this one was awesome!! My son and I shared it, very soft and full of moist raisins! Will for sure look for these in the store! Can't wait to try others!"

"Competitors",2020,"I received a sample courtesy Influenster, well... I didn't have the pleasure to taste it myself, because my son got ahold of it and started munching away!!  He absolutely loved this cookie :)  And that's saying alot, since my son can not stand raisins, period!  I guess I'm gonna have to add this one to my grocery list :)"
"Competitors",2021,"I got a  cookie to try in my Voxbox from Influenster. I gave it to my 8 year old son, who normally hates anything with raisins or anything remotely healthy, He loved it. Thanks  for getting my child to eat something different."
"Competitors",2020,"I received this cookie compliments of  via Influenster to try. My son ate it so quick. I love  and will be looking for these on our next grocery trip! My boy said it was delicious! We already buy the chewy oatmeal bars, adding these soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies to our list of Quaket products!"
"Competitors",2021,"I received the Raisin flavored from Influenster complimentary for tasting.  It was very good to me, not too sweet and not oily tasting like some package cookies. The fact that it is made with whole grain oats made it even better.  I am going to buy the cranberry & yogurt next."
"Competitors",2021,"I rec'd this product from  and  for testing purposes. I've always enjoyed  oats from the hot oatmeal, down to the cookie itself.  soft baked oatmeal cookie is made with whole grain  oats, At least 10 grams of whole grains per serving.Made with real fruit, Good source of fiber, delicious.  oats been around since over a hundred years."
"Competitors",2020,"I received one of these awesome cookies from Influenster! They are DELICIOUS!! Super soft and moist...tasted home made! :) Yummy!"
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are a great cookie. I love oatmeal cookies but the only thing I didn't like was the raisins. This is only because I hate raisins. So if you like raisins then you would probably like them. I probably wouldn't repurchase this for myself because I would rather make homemade without them. I would repurchase it for my boyfriend though because he loves raisins."
"Competitors",2021,"Soft, chewy and just like Grandma used to make. I can't wait until I eat the next cookie as these are something to savor and enjoy!"
"Competitors",2020,"From Influenster I received the  Soft Baked Cookie. With this product, after dinner one night, I divided it up into 3 equal portions. One for myself, one for my husband, and another for our 1 1/2 year old daughter.Our daughter devoured the cookie before I even sat back down and was asking for more. She absolutely loved it. My husband and I, on the other hand, were not impressed. We were expecting something a little more. The cookie itself was a little dry and there was something about the taste that was off a little bit.I do not think we will be buying this product in our home in the future. But I am pleasantly pleased with the chance to try it first."
"Competitors",2021,"My whole family absolutely loves these cookies...so soft and yummy!  And I like the fact that they are a nutritious treat for the kids...a much better option than candy or soda."
"Competitors",2022,"I loved how soft and delicious these cookies are! They are the new everyday snack in my house! Must have!"
"Competitors",2021,"I love the way these cookies taste just like homemade cookies. They are easy to take and eat on the go."
"Competitors",2022,"I thought that I might have had tried some of the tastiest oatmeal cookis before, but that wasn't so until I recently tried  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies . These cookies are so delicious. They taste just like homeade cookies. They are soft , full of raisins, and are just fabulous.I bought a box at my locl Walmart the other day for $2.18 for eight cookies. These are a good size cookie too. Iwll be back to buy mor of them for sure thanks to the wonderful ingredients from  I can't wait to try out the different varieties that  carries! A fan for life I am!!Thanks !! Thanks to Influenster for giving me the chance to try these cookies in my Vox Box! They were A+++."
"Competitors",2022,"I love this soft bake cookie I recived from !I enjoyed the Nutritious soft baked cookie and I plan to buy more for my family! great taste and Price!1"
"Competitors",2021,"The oatmeal raisin is the cookie that I've tried. I love it as well as my daughter. It's soft and tastes amazing. Not to mention cheap, I'll be buying more."
"Competitors",2022,"I really enjoyed the goodness of  Oatmeal combined with soft, plump and juicy raisins in a soft cookie. It is an irrisistable snack for the entire family and leaves you feeling full and satisfied."
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are so delicious.. I received one in my  mom voxbox and just had to repurchase.. So soft and chewy..def a must buy..happy customer over here..good job "
"Competitors",2022,"I received one of these cookies in my Influenster Mom VoxBox, these cookies, are really good and soft and chewy! I really enjoyed it! It tasted fresh, and not at all like a packaged cookie, I was also impressed at how well it held together during shipping, it was not crumbly like other cookies that have arrived in the mail."
"Competitors",2020,"These individually wrapped cookies taste fairly good. A little on the bland side, but the good side of the bland side, if there is such a thing. They are a nice sized cookie...bigger than other packaged cookies that come in the plastic trays. They have the perfect amount of raisins in them - not over packed, but just enough. I guess I expected them to be more ""oatmealy"" since they are from , after all. They have the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor going on, but not the texture.The complaint that I have with them is that they are SO very dry. You will definitely want to have a big glass of milk handy. That itself was another problem for me - I don't drink milk. I just don't like it. Yes, it is a personal problem, not a fault of  of course, but what else do you drink with cookies? Nothing else seems to go quite right with cookies. I do like to dunk cookies in milk, but these Oatmeal Raisin cookies are not a good choice for that because they would get mushy and fall apart right away.I can't say that i'd buy these. Much too dry for me and not enough flavor to make up for it."
"Competitors",2022,"Look, it's simple.  You want a good oatmeal raisin cookie, you bake them yourself or go to a bakery.  Stuff you get out of a box like this will never come close.  That said, for what this is, it's not bad.  At 3 in the morning when you're having a cookie emergency, they'll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  But don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.I can't really recommend them, but I can't entirely dismiss them either.  Consider them stop-gap and buy accordingly."
"Competitors",2021,"Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite type of cookie. My grandma makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies and a lady at church makes the second best. However, I'm always willing to try someone else's oatmeal raisin cookies. Recently,  started selling these SOFT-BAKED OATMEAL COOKIE WITH RAISINS. The cookies themselves aren't too bad. They're better than the usual store-bought oatmeal cookie. They're soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste. However, there's nothing that really distinguishes them either. There are 6 cookies in a box. They are good cookies that make a nice after lunch dessert or an in between snack."
"Competitors",2021,"Who doesn't love oatmeal cookies made with  Oats? I have many fond memories of enjoying making cookies straight out of the  oat box, enjoying them after-school or having them packed in my school lunchbag. When I saw these were available to test, I was naturally excited, I've always loved  oats and they make a quality product. Always.Unfortunately, I found these cookies to be remarkably bland and quite plain. They aren't sweet enough for my particular taste, nor are they remarkable in any way. Sure they have whole grain. But they taste too bland for me, and are indeed quite plain. No one in my family liked them. They were just completely generic. For me, they needed more cinnamon and sugar and vanilla for my taste preference.There are 6 individual cookies sealed in tiny packs, making them useful for travel/lunches."
"Competitors",2022,"I love oatmeal cookies, so I was really enthused about giving a new brand a try. However, these failed miserably in my mind - each individual cookie has 12g of sugar, yet there is a dry, bland taste. Combined with the fact that there are 170 calories, 6 grams of fat and 150 mg of sodium in each cookie, it's hardly worth eating if you don't even enjoy the taste!"
"Competitors",2021,"As promised, these cookies are nice and soft, and they're chewy.  Those are the good points.  The bad points are that they don't have all that much flavor.  They also have a heavier consistency than what I would prefer.  These cookies would benefit from more of the kinds of spices that can make cookies tasty- cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatnot.  I'd be willing to try these in a chocolate chip or other chocolate version, as the chocolate would add some flavor value, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these again."
"Competitors",2021,"I hardly noticed the raisins in this cookie, which is great if you don't like raisins, but I do like them.  The oatmeal flavor for the cookie is just as it should be.  When first opening the packet the aroma hinted at maybe a pinch of cinnamon added or maybe nutmeg in the mix.The consistency though was spongy, and rather dry.  I needed something to drink with it to help moisten it up."
"Competitors",2022,"I was impressed with the list of ingredients that included whole grain oat and whole grain wheat flour as well as whole grain rolled oats. Most cookies labeled ""oatmeal"" have enriched white flour as their main ingredient.  These cookies also have a generous amount of juicy raisins, not the dried out raisins found in some other brands.I did find the cookies a bit too sweet for my taste, especially on the first bite.  The sweetness was much less strong after that first bite. There is a natural grain aftertaste that I found pleasant but others may not.  Also, I found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened. I found that if I let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking.I liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale.  I also liked that the ingredient list is on each package; this is very important for those with food allergies if the box is not available.All in all though these are a good treat. Very enjoyable.  I would give it 3.5 stars if that rating were possible."
"Competitors",2021,"If you're thin & can eat cookies, enjoy yourself.  These come in single packs of mid-sized cookies (.73 oz. each), so I suppose it can help with portion control.  However, at 170 calories, it's pretty high for those needing to lose weight.  It only contains 2g of protein.  It also contains 12g of sugar, so I wouldn't call this a friendly treat for those people battling diabetes or who are borderline diabetics.  The ingredients are in very tiny print, in a box that is over 1.5 inches in length, & contains loads of ingredients I can barely pronounce & have no idea what they are.  It's is kinda soft & tastes okay; but it's not a cookie a foodie like myself gushes over."
"Competitors",2021,"I didn't expect a lot from a pre-packaged cookie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin!  It was surprisingly soft and chewy.  I also love that it's a somewhat healthy snack.  It would be even better warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds.  Good job,  :)I received this product complimentary for testing purposes through the Influenster Mom VoxBox."
"Competitors",2020,"I received this cookie to test from Influenster.  I had the raisin cookie and it was really so good!  I like that they use whole grains to make the cookie.  Breakfast really isn't my favorite meal of the day and I like something that is fast and easy.  This cookie is a good breakfast option for me.  I'm an on-the-go mom and it's easy to grab this to eat for breakfast or as a snack any time of day.  The cookie is a good size and it is moist and yummy.  I really liked it and will be buying more!"
"Competitors",2021,"I love how these  soft baked cookies taste. I love them warmed up or cold, either way they are quick and easy to eat on the go."
"Competitors",2020,"I really enjoyed the  soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie.  It's true...it tastes homemade!  Great for on the go when you need a treat or even for the kid's lunch boxes."
"Competitors",2021,"Cookies are soft and so good! Taste just like a regular cookie! I received cookie complimentary from  in my mombox and was delighted with how good it was."
"Competitors",2021,"These new  Oat Soft Baked Cookies are amazing! Soft and chewy. Very fresh and like they were just baked the day you bought them. My kids love them and it's a great way to give them their whole gains with a small serving of fruit. They are also great to pack in for a snack or a low calorie desert at 170 calories per cookie! I love these and will continue to purchase!"
"Competitors",2021,"I recieved this cookie FREE FROM INFLUENSTER.COM in their MOM VOXBOX 2012 THEME PRODUCT TESTING. and omg i loved it. it was soft and didnt taste so filling. it was light and great flavor tasting  i loved it"
"Competitors",2021,"I received a sample of this product for free to test from Influenster and .  The cookie did not last long and I ended up going out to buy a whole new box.My son is three and he said the cookie tasted ""kind of like a muffin"" and wanted to know if he could have one for breakfast the next day.  The cookie is very soft and the flavor is nice.  It tastes great with a big glass of milk or microwaved for 10 seconds or so to heat it up.  The individually wrapped cookies make them great to pack in lunches or keep in the car for an afternoon snack.  Truthfully, if they weren't individually wrapped, you could probably eat several in one sitting without even realizing it.Go ahead and plate them up and say you cooked them yourself.  They are pretty great!  Oh, and they're not bad nutritionally... so go ahead and eat one for breakfast... I won't tell."
"Competitors",2020,"These are the best oatmeal cookies ever! They're so soft and yummy. My whole family loves them,and I have a pretty picky family."
"Competitors",2020,"I love these cookies! They are so soft and my daughter eats them without any problems.I am a big oatmeal cookie fan, but s are the best brand so far."
"Competitors",2021,"This cookie was the bomb. It falls apart in your mouth...tastes fresh like grandma just brought it to you out of the oven! LOvvvee em!"
"Competitors",2022,"I tried the Oatmeal Raisin cookie and it was delicious.  The cookie is fairly big which is great.  It is soft and chewy so you don't have to worry about crumbs getting all over the place if your on the go.  I have already bought more!"
"Competitors",2021,"Well, if you ask my son, he might tell you it's better than his mommy's homemade oatmeal raisin cookies. :/ He loves the  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies and says they are ""Soft, chewy and Yummy!"" I'll be buying more!"
"Competitors",2022,"I found these cookies really moist and yummy. Good size and perfect for a snack break or for breakfast. My girls really liked them too. They remind of home made cookies. Good way to snack healthy."
"Competitors",2020,"Loved my  cookie it taste really good and is very soft unlike them other hard cookies. I could eat a whole box of these. Yes they taste that good"
"Competitors",2021,"I really loved this cookie. It was soft and a bit chewy. I think that if I had not read the box I would not think they are good for you. Definitley a treat worth trying. I was totally satisfied and wished more came in a box!"
"Competitors",2022,"I received this product in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster. I have tried other  products and loved them. These were just as good as the rest. I love how soft and chewy this oatmeal cookie was. The raisins were nice and juicy as well. I can't wait to grab a bigger size box or bag or whatever they may come in. It is well worth it."
"Competitors",2021,"I receive those cookies for review i love the flavor and all of it, i recommend 100%, my family love too, thanks  oatmeal cookier you are part of my family now!"
"Competitors",2021,"These cookies are so good an soft. When i had my wisdom teeth out after they healed I could not eat anything hard for a while an these cookies were so helpful even kids love them an there easy for on the go"
"Competitors",2021,"I was able to try this product through Influenster in my Mom Voxbox.  I had to share it with my 2 year old daughter since you can't eat cookies in front of kids lol!  It was delicious and soft baked, just like home made cookies.  My only complaint is that my cookie didn't have a good amount of raisins in it.  Maybe I just got a batch that missed a few extra raisins but I definitely felt that it could've used more.  Other than that, it was a great snack, especially to serve to kids!!  I can't wait to try the other flavors :)"
"Competitors",2021,"I received this sample in my Influenster MOMVOXBOX and I must say I wish I had gotten more than just one cookie.  It was delicious.  Shared it with my husband and he liked equally as well.  Very moist and flavorful."
"Competitors",2020,"I was able to enjoy this cookie because I received it in my VoxBox from Influenster. This cookie definitely does not skimp on any qualities a cookie should have. It was soft, chewy, fresh tasting and delicious. It is perfect for a quick breakfast or a quick snack or a yummy dessert with some ice cream. I will definitely be purchasing this item more often!"
"Competitors",2020,"I received the chocolate and almond  oatmeal cookie free to try from # in my #MomVoxBox, my 11 month old LOVED it!!

"Competitors",2021,"I received this cookie in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. My kids and I shared the cookie and we all enjoyed it.  I will buy more and try all the different flavors."
"Competitors",2022,"I didn't even know these existed until I received them in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster. Luckily only one of my children was with me when I opened it. We shared the Oatmeal Raisin cookie, and we both thought it was wonderful! So much so, that I went out and found them at our grocery store. Try them warmed! Nice size, and very soft and chewy. So yummy!! I really would like to try the different flavors as well. A very tasty product!!"

"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are absolutely amazing. My three year doesnt like a lot of snacks and cookies and hes very picky, but he likes a couple of these flavors. They are very soft and very delicious and extremely tasty, you almost forget that they are healthy for you. I absolutely love  oatmeal and these cookies are an extra treat."
"Competitors",2022,"From a he said she said point of view...He: (Who likes soft cookies) Thought they were good, chewy,  moist and delicious.She: (Who prefers a more crunchy cookie) I liked it but I wasn't crazy about it, taste was okay you could tell you were eating a whole grain cookie. The raisins saved this cookie for me.Over all we like  Oats, we would buy this cookie if we has a coupon but not as a number one on our list."
"Competitors",2022,"I was excited to receive a package of  Soft Baked Cookies through Influenster to try out.  I was surprised at how reasonable the ingredients were and how low in fat the single serve package was.  The cookie itself tasted fresh, soft and delicious.  I would definitely buy these for myself as a little treat and for the family.  Try them for yourself!"

I was excited about that, but I was even more excited when I opened it to see that there was a  Oatmeal soft baked cookie inside. I immediately opened it. It's one of the softest and most delicious cookies I have had in a long time. I immediately had two of my kids try a piece of it also. They loved it also! These cookies are rich in flavor, not dry, and all around a great cookie. I went out yesterday and bought two more boxes of them. These are a great product to keep handy for snack time! Absolutely love them!"

I was able to steal a small amount from her...It was so yummy and soft.  It was a nice size too. It was not small at all and you will get your moneys worth.  The fact that it has oatmeal is a plus, meaning my kids are putting something healthy in them when they are snacking.  I will definetely buy this product again and will recommend it to anyone.  If you want a yummy soft cookie with lots of flavor with none of the work and clean up after baking...go get a box of Soft Bake  Oatmeal Cookies...you won't be sorry. :-) I know my kids are happy that I tryed it....Thanks again Influenster and ."

"Competitors",2022,"Influenster sent me a  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie to test out and review in the Mom voxbox! WOW!! SO GOOD! And it really is so soft, if feels and tastes fresh baked. I only have one question, what took them so long to make these?? =) Really they are so good you wonder why they haven't thought of this years ago!Here are a few of the details! They are individually packaged, so they are great for on the go! They are made with yummy whole grain  oats! They are a good source of fiber and only have 6 grams of total fat per serving! I know you are dying to know where you can get these now! You can buy them at pretty much any major retailers and have a suggested retail of $2.69 for 6 cookies, That's less than $0.50 a cookie! Great deal! Give them a try and let me know how you like tem!"
"Competitors",2021,"I love all of 's products and so I didn't expect anything less from these cookies. I was not disappointed. The cookies are soft, chewy, and filling. They have the right amount of cinnamon and rasins in them. My kids even like them which is hard when it comes to oatmeal. I would definitely recommend these cookies if you love oatmeal rasin cookies."
"Competitors",2022,"I already loved  products, I grew up on them. This did not disappoint. Its a soft cookie, its a fulfilling treat and it has fiber :)"
"Competitors",2020,"These are some good cookies. my daughter loved these... now i must go out and buy more because my husband wants them for work."
"Competitors",2021,"I recieved a sample of this product from Influenster to try-then immediately went out and bought 2 more boxes, which are now gone also.

My kids love them too, especially when we cut them in half and put a little ice cream between the halves."
"Competitors",2022,"I received this from  in my mom voxbox omg i love the cookie i got only one sample i when to buy 4 more box's my family love's it thanks Influenster and !"

"Competitors",2021,"My whole family enjoyed the yummy goodness of  oatmeal cookies with raisins. My 3 year old couldn't get enough of them. It reminded me of my grandma's home made cookies. The taste brought me back to my childhood when I would help my grandma bake. So soft and I could taste the wholesome goodness in each bite. I will be buying more soon!"
"Competitors",2021,"I received this from  in my mom voxbox and my kids loved this cookie. I didn't even get a chance to try it and had to purchase a box. I highly recommend this cookie... Its a great snack and a healthier one!!!!"

"Competitors",2022,"My whole family loved this cookie! It is very soft and tastes great! It was so soft that my 8 month old even got to enjoy it, too!"
"Competitors",2021,"The cookie is soft and flavorful. It tastes good and the raisins are moist. My only complaint is the the cookie didn't stay together. It breaks apart very easily,"
"Competitors",2021,"I really loved the taste of these cookies. They tasted like they were home baked instead of manufactured like most store bought or packaged cookies. They seemed more nutritional than normal packaged cookies. I used to not like oat meal cookies but this may have changed my mind. I would definitely buy these again."
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are amazing! Great for snacks for the children. Nutritious yet satisfying. Will keep purchasing more of these. Amazing great taste."
"Competitors",2021,"What a great snack for on the run, in a purse or diaper bag, or even for a quick treat at home! Was delicious and pretty healthy compared to some cookies!"
"Competitors",2020,"We tried the soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies and fell in love with them! Being a mom and constantly on the go its hard to find a great snack for the kids but these cookies come individually wrapped and fit easily in your diaper bag, purse, lunch box or car. I would recommend these to every one:)"
"Competitors",2022,"As Soon as I received my sample in the Influenster Mom VoxBox from .com my 2 yr old ate it leaving me only a bite to sample. So I went to Walmart to buy more. All they had were the Apple Cinnamon ones and he ate the entire box! I luckily put up 1 cookie just in case and that was my cookie. Hubby and him are addicted and I can see why. They taste very fresh and everyone loves them!I got to try this product for free in my MomVoxBox from Influenster.comI'm an Influenster and Influence friends and family and yes, even strangers into trying new and amazing products!"
"Competitors",2020,"'s Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins are OK, but they left me wanting something better.  I thought they tasted good, but I found them to be a little on the dry side.  A lot of packaged cookies have an odd chemical aftertaste, but I didn't really notice much with these.However, I would like to see better choices on ingredients.  First, I don't understand the need for both bleached and unbleached flour.   should just stick with unbleached.  Second, I accept sugar as an ingredient.  These are cookies.  Cookies are sweet, and I expect sugar.  Yet why do they also have to use fructose, invert sugar syrup, corn syrup, and polydextrose?  These also contain molasses, which are a natural sweetener.  Finally, these have both corn starch and modified corn starch.  Again, why?  You may find other ingredients that you would question, but these seemed like the glaring issues to me.  In the end, I think this is too much to overcome when you combine it with a relatively high percentage (60 out of 170) of calories from fat.  In short, I cannot recommend these cookies."
"Competitors",2020,"I received one box of these cookies from the Amazon Vine program. I had not done any rsearch on them previously but remembered the oatmeal cookies my grandmother baked and how tasty they were. I was anxious to try out the  version. When the box arrived the first thing I noticed, right on the front of the box, was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping 170 calories. When I was a super active kid I ate my grandmother's cookies with impunity although I did not know the calorie count. I was always a skinny kid regardless of what I ate. Now, as an adult, I am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and I do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies. However, I wanted to do a taste test so I took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies. They have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count. Dry, stale and tasteless are the best descriptions I can come up with."
"Competitors",2020,"I received a box of these cookies through the Amazon Vine program, and I am not impressed.  I had rather high expectations since I generally like  products, and my family eats a lot of their chewy granola bars. These cookies are quite disappointing. They are soft, but they are also very dry. The raisins are totally desiccated and not even chewy because they are so dry and shriveled. The cookies themselves have a dry, rather powdery texture. At 170 calories per cookie, I plan to stick with 's chewy granola bars which taste much better and are in the 90-110 calorie range."
"Competitors",2020,"When it has came down to , they have really made some great products for snacking along the busy day. From their classic granola bars, to instant oatmeal on the go. But they have decided to step that up again with their soft baked oatmeal cookies. They absolutely taste very good. The feeling of being a simple cookie are worth their while. My only gripes about them is that their only 6 in a package so if you really are a heavy cookie snacker, you'll be a bit dissapointed. Also, there aren't that many in a package compared to the amount there are in a box from Little Debbie or other brands of cookies. Nevertheless, they are definitely delightful from , and if you're looking for a alternative to cookies, than this would be a good box to try.Price: BTaste: A-Overall: B+"
"Competitors",2021,"I am a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, and enjoy eating them for a snack or dessert. These are very good pre-made soft oatmeal-raisin cookies, and I have really enjoyed eating them. They are soft, chewy and they taste great. They are not too bad when it comes to nutrition either - each one of them is just 170 calories. The only downside for me about these cookies is that they seem to be a bit too crumbly, and not gooey enough. Each cookie comes in an individual wrapping, so tehy are very convenient to take with you for a snack on a go, and the individual wrapping also helps preserve freshness. Overall, a very good choice for fulfilling your sweet cravings."
"Competitors",2022,"The  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins have very good packaging, one relatively sturdy outside box and individually wrapped cookies inside. This is the high point. It goes down hill from there.Let me start with the taste. It is average at best, it is soft, but very cardboardy in taste which makes the sweetness of the raisins stand out even more. Often times with food, the trade-offs are great taste with bad nutrition versus average/bad taste with good nutrition. This one has both average/bad taste and bad nutrition. So what's the point of eating not-very-tasty junk food?Because let's face it, that's what this is. The list of ingredients is unnaturally long - 16 lines (yes sixteen lines) of ingredients on the box, including fan favorite Corn Syrup. This is just an oatmeal cookie for crying out loud.And here's the bad nutrition: 170 calories per cookie, including 5% cholesterol, 12g sugars, 6% sodium (150mg). On the plus side, 4g of dietary fiber and 2g of protein. Other numbers from the label: 6g of fat (1.5g saturated), 27g total carbs, and single digit percentages of iron and calcium. Each cookie weighs around 1.5 ounces, so this is not a giant cookie.If you are going to eat a cookie, at least eat a cookie you actually like. Otherwise, what's the point?"
"Competitors",2021,"Let me start off by saying I'm a bit of a cookie snob having lived next door to my grandmother for most of my youth.  There's nothing better than a homemade cookie.  Having tried these and shared them with some co-workers I can honestly say that it's not just me that wasn't impressed.  There wasn't much said that was positive.  For being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry.  It was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie.  There was no yummy buttery taste.  They just weren't worth the 170 cals per cookie.  The only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks."
"Competitors",2021,"I receive a sample of this cookie in  a complimentary box to review from  it was delicious I have never tried these but I would recommend them to anyone"
"Competitors",2021,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 4:14 Mins</span>These are very good, not too sweet, not too crumbly, slightly dry, good raisins with low ratio, excellent texture, very natural tasting (nothing artificial), dense & filling enough.  For a store bought cookie, they are very good.  There is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  They taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  Most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  These hold up well.  The raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  They are moderately sized, smaller that I would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  They are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, I thought they were very good.One thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using  oats and being a good source of fiber.  They do have 16% fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry 9% of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  Compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  Just don't think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  But if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway."
"Competitors",2020,"I received  Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in Raisin complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.I have an off again on again relationship with oatmeal cookies because some oatmeal cookies have a very gritty texture from the oatmeal. I was pleasantly surprised that the pieces of cookie I tested were not very gritty, and the raisin was delicious. There is NO WAY these were not homemade in some shape or fashion. They are so delicious.With only 6 grams of fat,170 calories, and 12g of sugar per serving (1 cookie) I would consider it a healthier alternative to other cookies on the market. I've already went to the store and purchased another box.You won't be disappointed in trying these cookies out!"
"Competitors",2020,"I loved this cookie! I received it in my mom vox box from , and that was the first thing me and my daughter tried. (: She absolutely loved it, and I will be buying more and put them in my diaper bag, for on the go trips (:"
"Competitors",2021,"Hello, I received this cookie in my @ Mom VoxBox to review and i have to say i was very pleased with the taste, texture and the enormous size of the cookie. I am happy with  Products, i always have been ever since i was little. I now pass the nutritional products to my children as my grandma passed it on to me."
"Competitors",2022,"I like the cookies while on the go.  They are soft and chewy and have the goodness of  products.  If you don't have time to bake, then give these cookies a try.  They taste great.  I sampled the product thanks to Influenster and I am so thankful for that!"
"Competitors",2022,"i recived a free sample from Influenster and let me tell you it was so good and soft it crumbles up right in your mouth and its a big cookie my daughter also loved it i would difenitly recommend buying it if you like oatmeal and raisins"
"Competitors",2022,"These cookies are a great quick snack for the kids. They did not even complain about the raisins, I think they gobble them up before they even notice!"
"Competitors",2020,"I received a sample of these and quickly went out and purchased a box. These are super soft cookies that are individually wrapped for convenience. The individually wrapped cookie is a huge feature here as the cookies stay fresh and soft in a easily tote-able package. You get the great taste of  oat cookies without the work of baking them! Toss in the kids lunch bag, spouse lunch box, pack for a picnic, use in birthday party favor bags for a healthy alternative! Great tasting, great portability, great texture. love them!!"
"Competitors",2022,"My children love these cookies. They are very soft and taste awesome. Will be buying more for sure.The best cookies we ever tried."
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies were so soft and yummy. You would think they were fresh out of the oven. I will definitely be getting more of these for my house :O)"
"Competitors",2020,"My whole family loves these cookies. And my son tried to stuff the whole thing in his mouth. I just bought some yesterday & I think I will have to get some more soon."
"Competitors",2022,"I have fallen in love with 's Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie! I tried them in my mom voxbox from Influenster and it was so good. It tasted like a homemade cookie to me. I love the fact that these cookies are not high in sugar like other ones. I went out and bought a box of the apple cinnamon to try and love them as well. My family loves the  brand and will continue to buy and recommend ."
"Competitors",2022,"i love these soft cookies. they taste like fresh baked out of the oven. the oatmeal is very sweet and tasty"
"Competitors",2022,"I absolutely loved these new cookies. They were so soft and yummy. The kids also enjoyed them. I saw them in the store also and they price wasn't bad. I'll be a returning customer for these."
"Competitors",2022,"I received this amazing Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom VoxBox. I'm normally not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies since I don't like raisins, but this was delicious! The cookie was thick and tasted homemade with a nice oatmeal flavor. I'm definitely going to buy more of these."
"Competitors",2021,"I got one of these in my Influenster Mom VoxBox! OMG they were so good, My daughter and I shared the first one then i went and got another box! This are a must have now!

"Competitors",2021,"~ Quick Take: Tasty, chewy, soft-baked cookies with oats and raisins that the whole family can enjoy! =)~ Usage Tips: Eat them as a snack, dessert or basically anytime of the day. They go well with a cup of tea or maybe with a cup of coffee in the morning.~ The Verdict: Next time you're at the store, don't leave without picking up some  soft baked oatmeal cookies! They are good to take ""on-the-go"" since they are individually packaged. They are a healthy treat, provides a good source of fiber, contains 6 grams of total fat per serving, and made with whole grain  Oats! You can't beat that! Try them out, I'm sure you'll love them as much as I did! =D"
"Competitors",2022,"The cookie didn't make it much further than out of the box. It was big enough to split between my two daughters and it was a HIT with my super-picky eaters. I got a very small bite and loved it. It really did taste like something that could have baked in my own kitchen. I will definitely be buying more of these cookies and maybe next time I will get a whole one."
"Competitors",2020,"My kids or I didn't care for it much, they tossed it after a few bites, and what kids throw away cookies????"
"Competitors",2020,"If I could give it zero stars I would......horrible taste and not much of that either. Like a very hint of molasses that was too old to use. If I had never had an oatmeal raisin cookie before and this was my first taste of one I would never try one again. QUAKER....pull these off the shelves of any store selling them and throw them in the garbage where they belong. This product gives  a bad name. PLEASE.... don't waste your money on these and don't tell your kids they can have one for a treat, they are more like something you would give them for a punishment...."
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are soft and delicious.  Possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats, they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Instead they are almost melt-in-your mouth, with nicely soft raisins as well.  Perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie.  I enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn't mind if it was brought more to the forefront.I don't usually buy individually wrapped food, so I don't think I'd buy this product again, but I would certainly recommend it to others."
"Competitors",2022,"I cannot say these taste like home made but the are not that far off. I like their chewiness and I am a crispy cookie person.  These are very tasty in fact they are too tasty I wanted to eat them all at once.  I would love to dip these I melted chocolate or make a sandwich cookie out of them by putting some kind of frosting or chocolate in the middle. Oh my would that be great.These are not too sweet they are just right basically in every way.  I like the fact that they come individually wrapped so you can put them in your lunch bag or send them with your children for their noon meal. Each cookie is 170 calories and that is not bad considering the size of them, they are quit big and should satisfy anyone's urge for a sweet treat.I am very pleased with these cookies and would definitely buy them again."
"Competitors",2020,"this cookie is super soft and chewy.i love it and also try their oatmeal cookies,they are the bomb diggitty!!!i would recommend this to everyone.i received this in my mom voxbox and my kids loved it!!"
"Competitors",2020,"These cookies are reasonably tasty without being too sweet. The individual packing keeps them nice and moist and makes it easy to include one in a packed lunch.That said, they are not so special that I'd make an effort to seek them out. Also, the fact that each cookie is 170 calories would keep me from having them too often. Luckily, the individual packing will keep them fresh till you feel like having one."
"Competitors",2022,"I loved these cookies and so did my kids. You can read my full review here [...] My favorite part was definitely the taste, and I'm not even an oatmeal cookie fan."
"Competitors",2022,"This is a great tasting cookie. It is very soft and the texture is very smooth. I usually do not like oatmeal cookies because the texture is very gritty and tough. This cookie does not have that problem. It tastes like your Mom just made it."
"Competitors",2022,"I love the  soft baked cookies.  The really are soft and taste great.  I tried the oatmeal raisin, and cant wait to try the other flavors.  They all look really good."
"Competitors",2022,"This cookie is really good and works really well for my family.  In the morning it fits in to my morning routine.  I take the cookie put it in the microwave and out the door we go with my tea.  Something I can eat at my desk or on the run.  It holds me over till lunch and is not too heavy."
